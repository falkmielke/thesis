    abstract = { In this paper we have discussed what appears to be a superior implementation of the Algebraic Reconstruction Technique (ART). The method is based on 1) simultaneous application of the error correction terms as computed by ART for all rays in a given projection; 2) longitudinal weighting of the correction terms back-distributed along the rays; and 3) using bilinear elements for discrete approximation to the ray integrals of a continuous image. Since this implementation generates a good reconstruction in only one iteration, it also appears to have a computational advantage over the more traditional implementation of ART. Potential applications of this implementation include image reconstruction in conjunction with ray tracing for ultrasound and microwave tomography in which the curved nature of the rays leads to a non-uniform ray density across the image. },

    abstract = {Abstract X-Ray Reconstruction of Moving Morphology (XROMM) comprises a set of 3D X-ray motion analysis techniques that merge motion data from in vivo X-ray videos with skeletal morphology data from bone scans into precise and accurate animations of 3D bones moving in 3D space. XROMM methods include: (1) manual alignment (registration) of bone models to video sequences, i.e., Scientific Rotoscoping; (2) computer vision-based autoregistration of bone models to biplanar X-ray videos; and (3) marker-based registration of bone models to biplanar X-ray videos. Here, we describe a novel set of X-ray hardware, software, and workflows for marker-based XROMM. Refurbished C-arm fluoroscopes retrofitted with high-speed video cameras offer a relatively inexpensive X-ray hardware solution for comparative biomechanics research. Precision for our biplanar C-arm hardware and analysis software, measured as the standard deviation of pairwise distances between 1 mm tantalum markers embedded in rigid objects, was found to be ±0.046 mm under optimal conditions and ±0.084 mm under actual in vivo recording conditions. Mean error in measurement of a known distance between two beads was within the 0.01 mm fabrication tolerance of the test object, and mean absolute error was 0.037 mm. Animating 3D bone models from sets of marker positions (XROMM animation) makes it possible to study skeletal kinematics in the context of detailed bone morphology. The biplanar fluoroscopy hardware and computational methods described here should make XROMM an accessible and useful addition to the available technologies for studying the form, function, and evolution of vertebrate animals.

Micro-CT requires staining with heavy chemical elements (and thus fixation and sometimes dehydration) in order to make soft tissue imageable when measured alongside denser structures. LSMF requires fixation, decalcification, dehydration, clearing and staining with a fluorescent dye. The specimen preparation of both imaging methods is prone to shrinkage, which is often not mentioned, let alone quantified. In this paper the presence and degree of shrinkage are quantitatively identified for the selected preparation methods/stains. LSFM delivers a volume shrinkage of 17\% for bone, 56\% for muscle and 62\% for brain tissue. The three most popular micro-CT stains (phosphotungstic acid, iodine with potassium iodide, and iodine in absolute ethanol) deliver a volume shrinkage ranging from 10 to 56\% for muscle and 27–66\% for brain, while bone does not shrink in micro-CT preparation.}},

In order to analyze the influence of the inverse dynamic method, the joint forces and moments were computed during gait on nine healthy subjects. A ratio was computed between the relative dispersions (due to the method) and the absolute amplitudes of the gait curves. The influence of the inverse dynamic method was negligible at the ankle (2\%) but major at the knee and the hip joints (40\%). This influence seems to be due to the dynamic computation rather than the kinematic computation. Compared to the influence of the joint center location, the body segment inertial parameter estimation, and more, the influence of the inverse dynamic method is at least of equivalent importance. This point should be confirmed with other subjects, possibly pathologic, and other movements.}},

Characterising these parameters accurately in three dimensions is challenging with traditional methods requiring dissection or suspension of cadavers. Here, we present a method to quantify the three-dimensional centre of mass and inertia tensor of birds of prey using calibrated computed tomography (CT) scans. The technique was validated using several independent methods, providing body segment mass estimates within approximately 1\% of physical dissection measurements and moment of inertia measurements with a 0.993 R2 correlation with conventional trifilar pendulum measurements. Calibrated CT offers a relatively straightforward, non-destructive approach that yields highly detailed mass distribution data that can be used for three-dimensional dynamics modelling in biomechanics. Although demonstrated here with birds, this approach should work equally well with any animal or appendage capable of being CT scanned.}},

Substantial evidence is accumulating about the advantages of IR algorithms over established analytical methods, such as filtered back projection. IR improves image quality through cyclic image processing. Although all available solutions share the common mechanism of artifact reduction and/or potential for radiation dose savings, chiefly due to image noise suppression, the magnitude of these effects depends on the specific IR algorithm. In the first section of this contribution, the technical bases of IR are briefly reviewed and the currently available algorithms released by the major CT manufacturers are described. In the second part, the current status of their clinical implementation is surveyed. Regardless of the applied IR algorithm, the available evidence attests to the substantial potential of IR algorithms for overcoming traditional limitations in CT imaging. },

    abstract = {Abstract Centre of mass is a fundamental anatomical and biomechanical parameter. Knowledge of centre of mass is essential to inform studies investigating locomotion and other behaviours, through its implications for segment movements, and on whole body factors such as posture. Previous studies have estimated centre of mass position for a range of organisms, using various methodologies. However, few studies assess the accuracy of the methods that they employ, and often provide only brief details on their methodologies. As such, no rigorous, detailed comparisons of accuracy and repeatability within and between methods currently exist. This paper therefore seeks to apply three methods common in the literature (suspension, scales and digital modelling) to three ‘calibration objects’ in the form of bricks, as well as three birds to determine centre of mass position. Application to bricks enables conclusions to be drawn on the absolute accuracy of each method, in addition to comparing these results to assess the relative value of these methodologies. Application to birds provided insights into the logistical challenges of applying these methods to biological specimens. For bricks, we found that, provided appropriate repeats were conducted, the scales method yielded the most accurate predictions of centre of mass (within 1.49 mm), closely followed by digital modelling (within 2.39 mm), with results from suspension being the most distant (within 38.5 mm). Scales and digital methods both also displayed low variability between centre of mass estimates, suggesting they can accurately and consistently predict centre of mass position. Our suspension method resulted not only in high margins of error, but also substantial variability, highlighting problems with this method.},

A simple experiment was performed to establish a calibration curve of physical density vs. CT number which, within the constraints of beam hardening and other sources of CT number variation and drift, is unique to the specific scanner being calibrated. By expressing attenuation values in terms of physical density, the mass in grams of any organ or tumor can be calculated in vivo, from its volume determined also by CT. As an example, density of bone becomes additional information with any CT scan done for another purpose that includes plane(s) across a skeletal structure. },

    abstract = {Compared to single source systems, stereo X-ray CT systems allow acquiring projection data within a reduced amount of time, for an extended field-of-view, or for dual X-ray energies. To exploit the benefit of a dual X-ray system, its acquisition geometry needs to be calibrated. Unfortunately, in modular stereo X-ray CT setups, geometry misalignment occurs each time the setup is changed, which calls for an efficient calibration procedure. Although many studies have been dealing with geometry calibration of an X-ray CT system, little research targets the calibration of a dual cone-beam X-ray CT system. In this work, we present a phantom-based calibration procedure to accurately estimate the geometry of a stereo cone-beam X-ray CT system. With simulated as well as real experiments, it is shown that the calibration procedure can be used to accurately estimate the geometry of a modular stereo X-ray CT system thereby reducing the misalignment artifacts in the reconstruction volumes.},

We describe our development of this methodology. Issues addressed include the physics of mapping CT density to mass density; development and scanning of density standards; post-reconstruction filtering to reduce the effects of quantum noise; and segmentation of the object data from the surrounding medium. Examples of our use of this procedure in studying density gradients during powder pressing and firing are given.},

Removing or at least significantly reducing such artefacts is indispensable. However, since micro-CT systems are pushed to the extremes in the quest for the ultimate spatial resolution, ring artefacts can hardly be avoided. Moreover, as opposed to clinical CT systems, conventional correction schemes such as flat-field correction do not lead to satisfactory results. Therefore, in this note a simple but efficient and fast post processing method is proposed that effectively reduces ring artefacts in reconstructed μ-CT images.},

    abstract = {The discrete algebraic reconstruction technique (DART) is a tomographic method to reconstruct images from X-ray projections in which prior knowledge on the number of object materials is exploited. In monochromatic X-ray CT (e.g., synchrotron), DART has been shown to lead to high-quality reconstructions, even with a low number of projections or a limited scanning view. However, most X-ray sources are polychromatic, leading to beam hardening effects, which significantly degrade the performance of DART. In this work, we propose a new discrete tomography algorithm, poly-DART, that exploits sparsity in the attenuation values using DART and simultaneously accounts for the polychromatic nature of the X-ray source. The results show that poly-DART leads to a vastly improved segmentation on polychromatic data obtained from Monte Carlo simulations as well as on experimental data, compared to DART.},

    abstract = {Purpose: To reduce beam hardening artifacts in CT in case of an unknown x-ray spectrum and unknown material properties. Methods: The authors assume that the object can be segmented into a few materials with different attenuation coefficients, and parameterize the spectrum using a small number of energy bins. The corresponding unknown spectrum parameters and material attenuation values are estimated by minimizing the difference between the measured sinogram data and a simulated polychromatic sinogram. Three iterative algorithms are derived from this approach: two reconstruction algorithms IGR and IFR, and one sinogram precorrection method ISP. Results: The methods are applied on real x-ray data of a high and a low-contrast phantom. All three methods successfully reduce the cupping artifacts caused by the beam polychromaticity in such a way that the reconstruction of each homogeneous region is to good accuracy homogeneous, even in case the segmentation of the preliminary reconstruction image is poor. In addition, the results show that the three methods tolerate relatively large variations in uniformity within the segments. Conclusions: We show that even without prior knowledge about materials or spectrum, effective beam hardening correction can be obtained.},

The final purification processes involve differential adsorption on talc and fractional precipitation from petroleum ether, for components a and b respectively. The steps of the procedure are presented in detail. 2. The absorption spectra of chlorophylls a and b were measured accurately from λ 3950-7800 Å. by a photoelectric method. Absorption coefficients at the maxima and minima were determined with an accuracy of 1.0\%. The visible spectrum of each component consists of seven bands. 3. Spectral data indicate that the components prepared by WILLSTATTER and STOLL and by TSWETT were not separated completely from one another. The spectral method for detection of impurities is discussed. 4. A comparative study was made of the colors of a and b in various solvents and of certain chlorophyll derivatives. 5. Different tests of purity are discussed and it is concluded that a critical examination of the absorption spectrum is the most reliable and sensitive test. 6. Sources of leaf material and component yields are presented. 7. The improved preparation procedure is critically compared with previous methods. 8. It is suggested that there is at least one component other than chlorophylls a and b in the chlorophyll complex. Possible sources of error in the purification procedure are discussed. 9. Attempts to isolate the third "component c" were unsuccessful. Its properties are intermediate between those of components a and b. 10. Quantitative analytical data affirm the existence of a third component c. },
