  abstract  = {Tayassuidae is a family of pig-like Artiodactyla restricted to the New World. Despite its rich fossil history, they have received less attention from a taxonomic and phylogenetic perspective when compared to the Old World pigs, Suidae. In this study, we performed a computer assisted phylogenetic analysis using morphological and molecular data including fossil and extant Tayassuidae, using parsimony and Bayesian approaches. We recovered the monophyly of the family Tayassuidae, confirming previous proposals, as well as the monophyly of the subfamilies Hesperhyinae and Tayassuinae, and the genus Platygonus, which we placed in a new taxon of tribe level. The three living peccaries and a number of fossil species belong to a new, tribe level, monophyletic group. The genus Catagonus comes out as paraphyletic, leading us to propose to restrict the generic name to the type species, C. metropolitanus, and a new taxonomic arrangement for the remaining species previously included in it, revalidating the genera Brasiliochoerus and Parachoerus, and describing a new genus, Protherohyus, gen. nov.},

  abstract  = {The evolution of perissodactyls (rhinoceroses, tapirs, and horses) has been well studied primarily because of their extensive fossil record. Nevertheless, controversy persists regarding relationships of some of the extant taxa, reflecting inconsistencies between molecular and morphological studies. Here we examine the phylogenetic relationships of 16 living perissodactyl species by concatenating two mitochondrial and nine nuclear genes, and we estimate their divergence times using a relaxed Bayesian molecular clock approach. Our analyses recovered the monophyly of the suborders Ceratomorpha and Hippomorpha, and the families Rhinoceratidae, Tapiridae, and Equidae. We supported the early divergence of the Indian rhinoceros in the late Oligocene (26 Mya) relative to the Sumatran and African rhinoceroses, and the split of caballine (domestic horse and Przewalski's wild horse) and noncaballine equids (zebras and African and Asiatic asses) in the Pliocene (4 Mya). An important implication of this study is that Equus asinus, the African wild ass was found to be the sister taxon of Asiatic asses and zebras, diverging from the common ancestor with caballine horses 2 Mya. Rates of chromosome rearrangements were also evaluated in perissodactyls, placing a notably high rate of variation amongst equids, particularly within the zebra clade. The robust phylogenetic results presented here are relevant in terms of understanding the evolutionary history of this highly threatened group of mammals.},

  abstract  = {Abstract We present the first phylogenies to include all extant species of Perissodactyla (odd-toed hoofed mammals) and the recently extinct quagga (Equus quagga). Two independent data sets were examined; one based on multiple genes and analyzed using both supertree and supermatrix approaches, and a second being a supertree constructed from trees collected from the scientific literature. All methods broadly confirmed the traditional view of perissodactyl interfamily relationships, with Equidae (= Hippomorpha) forming the sister-group to the clade Rhinocerotidae + Tapiridae (= Ceratomorpha). The contentious affinity of the Sumatran rhino (Dicerorhinus sumatrensis) is resolved in favour of it forming a clade with the two Asian rhinos (genus Rhinoceros). However, no data set or tree-building method managed to satisfactorily resolve the historically contentious relationships among extant equids; little agreement appears among the different trees for this group. In general, both the supertree and supermatrix approaches performed equally well, but both were hindered by the current paucity of data (e.g. no single gene has been sequenced to date for all 17 species) and its patchy distribution within Equidae. More data, both molecular and morphological, are required for all species to resolve the poorly supported nodes. (? 2009 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim)},

Although African suids have been of scientific interest for over two centuries, their origin, evolution, phylogeography and phylogenetic relationships remain contentious. There has been a long-running debate concerning the evolution of pigs and hogs (Suidae), particularly regarding the phylogenetic relationships among extant Eurasian and African species of the subfamily Suinae. To investigate these issues, we analysed the mitochondrial and nuclear DNA sequences of extant genera of Suidae from Eurasia and Africa. Molecular phylogenetic analyses revealed that all extant sub-Saharan African genera form a monophyletic clade separate from Eurasian suid genera, contradicting previous attempts to resolve the Suidae phylogeny. Two major sub-Saharan African clades were identified, with Hylochoerus and Phacochoerus grouping together as a sister clade to Potamochoerus. In addition, we find that the ancestors of extant African suids may have evolved separately from the ancestors of modern day Sus and Porcula in Eurasia before they colonised Africa. Our results provide a revision of the intergeneric relationships within the family Suidae.},

Here, we gathered all mitochondrial genetic data available in GenBank to build a robust Cetartiodactyla calibrated phylogenetic tree using 21 fossil calibration points. We found mitogenomic data for 225 species and included other 93 species from which there was at least one mitochondrial gene available. Using a Bayesian approach, we generated a dated tree comprising 90% of the extant Cetartiodactyla species (n = 318). The major lineages showed robust support and families divergence times are congruent with the available fossil evidence and with previously published phylogenetic hypotheses.

  abstract  = {The order Cetartiodactyla includes cetaceans (whales, dolphins and porpoises) that are found in all oceans and seas, as well as in some rivers, and artiodactyls (ruminants, pigs, peccaries, hippos, camels and llamas) that are present on all continents, except Antarctica and until recent invasions, Australia. There are currently 332 recognized cetartiodactyl species, which are classified into 132 genera and 22 families. Most phylogenetic studies have focused on deep relationships, and no comprehensive time-calibrated tree for the group has been published yet. In this study, 128 new complete mitochondrial genomes of Cetartiodactyla were sequenced and aligned with those extracted from nucleotide databases. Our alignment includes 14,902 unambiguously aligned nucleotide characters for 210 taxa, representing 183 species, 107 genera, and all cetartiodactyl families. Our mtDNA data produced a statistically robust tree, which is largely consistent with previous classifications. However, a few taxa were found to be para- or polyphyletic, including the family Balaenopteridae, as well as several genera and species. Accordingly, we propose several taxonomic changes in order to render the classification compatible with our molecular phylogeny. In some cases, the results can be interpreted as possible taxonomic misidentification or evidence for mtDNA introgression. The existence of three new cryptic species of Ruminantia should therefore be confirmed by further analyses using nuclear data. We estimate divergence times using Bayesian relaxed molecular clock models. The deepest nodes appeared very sensitive to prior assumptions leading to unreliable estimates, primarily because of the misleading effects of rate heterogeneity, saturation and divergent outgroups. In addition, we detected that Whippomorpha contains slow-evolving taxa, such as large whales and hippos, as well as fast-evolving taxa, such as river dolphins. Our results nevertheless indicate that the evolutionary history of cetartiodactyls was punctuated by four main phases of rapid radiation during the Cenozoic era: the sudden occurrence of the three extant lineages within Cetartiodactyla (Cetruminantia, Suina and Tylopoda); the basal diversification of Cetacea during the Early Oligocene; and two radiations that involve Cetacea and Pecora, one at the Oligocene/Miocene boundary and the other in the Middle Miocene. In addition, we show that the high species diversity now observed in the families Bovidae and Cervidae accumulated mainly during the Late Miocene and Plio-Pleistocene.},

The aim of this cadaver study is to report all orientation and position changes of the finite helical axes (FHA) as a function of joint angle for different equine forelimb joints. Five horse cadaver forelimbs with standardized cuts at the midlevel of each segment were used. Bone pins with reflective marker triads were drilled into the forelimb bones. Unless joint angles were anatomically coupled, each joint was manually moved independently in all three rotational degrees of freedom (flexion?extension, abduction?adduction, internal?external rotation). The 3D coordinates of the marker triads were recorded using a six infra-red camera system. The FHA and its orientational and positional properties were calculated and expressed against joint angle over the entire range of motion using a finite helical axis method. When coupled, joint angles and FHA were expressed in function of flexion?extension angle. Flexion?extension movement was substantial in all forelimb joints, the shoulder allowed additional considerable motion in all three rotational degrees of freedoms. The position of the FHA was constant in the fetlock and elbow and a constant orientation of the FHA was found in the shoulder. Orientation and position changes of the FHA over the entire range of motion were observed in the carpus and the interphalangeal joints. We report FHA position and orientation changes as a function of flexion?extension angle to allow for inclusion in a musculoskeletal model of a horse to minimize calculation errors caused by incorrect location of the FHA.},

Mammalian limbs are usually characterized in terms of vertical orientation and parasagittal excursion; the assumption prevails that this type of stance and limb movement is typical of the class. In the present study, walking movements in eight mammalian species (Tachyglossus aculeatus, Didelphis marsupialis, Tupaia glis. Mesocricetus auratus, Rattus norvegicus, Mustela putorius, Heterohyrax brucei, and Felis domestica) were studied cineradiographically with particular attention given to limb posture and excursion relative to the parasagittal and horizontal planes. Only the cat and, to a lesser degree, the hyrax conform to the postural and locomotory pattern that has been regarded as characteristic of most terrestrial, quadrupedal mammals. In the other six species, the humeri and femora usually function in positions more horizontal than vertical and at angles oblique to the parasagittal plane. Furthermore, the excursion pattern of these species have interspecific differences; some patterns are more variable than others. The classical conception of ?mammalian posture? and ?mammalian locomotion? is inaccurate both as a description of the features possessed in common by living terrestrial mammals and as a hypothetical approximation of the condition in ancestral mammals. At present, non-cursorial mammals such as the opossum and tree shrew are more realistic models on which to base deductions concerning posture and locomotion in eatly mammals.},

They were pursued to make them run as fast as possible. The films have been analysed to determine speed, stride frequency, stride and step lengths, and duty factors. The dependence of these quantities on body size is discussed. Summary: Fast locomotion of zebra, giraffe, warthog and seven species of Bovidae has been studied. The animals were filmed from a pursuing vehicle while galloping in their natural habitat. Stride frequency was more closely correlated with limb length (represented by hip height) than with body mass. Mean stride frequency was proportional to (hip height)-0·51 and maximum stride frequency to (hip height) -0·63. Maximum speed was between 10 and 14 m s -1 for all species except buffalo (7 m s -1). It was not significantly correlated with body mass. Since the small species ran at least as fast as the large ones they attained higher Froude numbers. Relative stride length was approximately 1·8 (Froude number)0·39 for all species, irrespective of size. Relative step length was approximately 0·65 (Froude number)0·2, both for the fore feet and for the hind ones. The vertical forces exerted by the feet are proportional to (body weight)?(Froude number)0·2 so the forces at maximum speed are larger multiples of body weight for small species than for large ones.},

Data for a diverse sample of mammals have been used to test the hypothesis. It is found to be tenable in many cases when comparisons are confined to quadrupedal mammals of the type described by Jenkins (1971) as ?cursorial?. Most mammals of mass greater than 5 kg are of this type. Although the hypothesis applies less successfully to comparisons between cursorial and non-cursorial mammals it is shown to be a reasonable approximation even for such comparisons and for comparisons between quadrupedal mammals and bipedal mammals and birds.},

  abstract  = {This paper focuses on the concept of cursoriality in mammals and aims to point out the confusion that can arise when a classical term is not explicitly redefined or expanded to incorporate the results of biomechanical techniques. Historically, the definition of ?cursorial? was based qualitatively on an animal's morphology and behaviour, generally referring to large, terrestrial mammals that ran fast or far across open spaces. However, in recent years, as biomechanicists have learned how to quantify aspects of limb movement and bone orientation, a more specific meaning of this term has come into use. Results from these new techniques have highlighted the lack of specificity in the historical definition and have led us to propose a clarified, quantitative definition of ?cursorial?. The exceptional nature of bovids and primates with respect to this new definition is also addressed in our analysis. We recognize that the definition we propose is, itself, not sufficient because it cannot be applied to fossil taxa and because kinematic data are still lacking for many taxa. Hence, we look forward to the eventual adoption of an even more expanded definition or suite of terms that will further distinguish between all attributes of cursorial mammals and that will reflect an increased understanding of their evolutionary origins.},

  abstract  = {Abstract Alpacas are increasingly popular as domesticated companion and commercial animals. Their footfall patterns, however, are not well documented. It would be fascinating to know if artificial selection has changed alpacas' locomotor patterns from the ancestral condition in the vicuña. Some members of the Camelidae pace rather than trot, but the gaits of most species have not been studied quantitatively. Thus, investigating alpacas' gaits might contribute to understanding the factors influencing gait choice and evolution. We aimed to quantify the temporal footfall patterns of alpacas to determine observed gaits and to describe gait parameters as a function of speed. Kinematic data (3D motion capture) of locomotor patterns over a range of speeds were collected from four alpacas. We quantified the influence of speed on stance time, swing time, stride time (and frequency), duty factor and stride length, and created gait diagrams for symmetrical and asymmetrical gaits. Alpacas moved using lateral sequence walks, mainly lateral couplets walks and runs with some lateral sequence, singlefoot footfall patterns. Remarkably, the alpacas never truly paced or trotted. At faster speeds, they switched to asymmetrical gaits, predominantly transverse gallops. With increasing speed, stance and stride times decreased, and stride frequencies and stride length increased. Swing times decreased slightly with speed for symmetrical gaits, and a tendency towards an increasing swing time was evident in asymmetrical gaits. It is still uncertain why quadrupeds choose particular gaits and intriguingly, extant camelids (alpacas, dromedary camels) do not trot. The apparent absence of pacing in alpacas deserves further investigation in an experimental and comparative framework. Yet, this absence seems inherited from their vicuña ancestors, indicating that pacing gaits may not be ancestral or common for Camelidae. Future studies should include kinetic and anatomical data to provide insight into whole-body mechanics, and include other unstudied species such as guanacos and vicuñas.},

This review of two parameters, Fr and dimensionless velocity β=(Fr)1/2, that have served as the criterion for dynamic similarity, has been arranged in two parts: (I) historical development, including the contributions by William Froude and his son Edmund, two ship designers who lived more than 130 years ago, the classic insights of D’Arcy Wentworth Thompson who, in his magnum opus On Growth and Form, espoused the connection between mathematics and biology, and the pioneering efforts of Robert McNeill Alexander, who popularised the application of Fr to animal locomotion; and (II) selected applications, including a comparison of walking for people of different heights, exploring the effects of different gravitational fields on human locomotion, establishing the impact of pathology and the benefits of treatment, and understanding the walking patterns of bipedal robots. Although not all applications of Fr to locomotion have been covered, the review offers an important historical context for all researchers of bipedal gait, and extends the idea of dimensionless scaling of gait parameters.},

  abstract  = {Abstract The Froude number has been widely used in anthropology to adjust for size differences when comparing gait parameters or other nonmorphological locomotor variables (such as optimal walking speed or speed at gait transitions) among humans, nonhuman primates, and fossil hominins. However, the dynamic similarity hypothesis, which is the theoretical basis for Froude number corrections, was originally developed and tested at much higher taxonomic levels, for which the ranges of variation are much greater than in the intraspecific or intrageneric comparisons typical of anthropological studies. Here we present new experimental data on optimal walking speed and the mass-specific cost of transport at that speed from 19 adult humans walking on a treadmill, and evaluate the predictive power of the dynamic similarity hypothesis in this sample. Contrary to the predictions of the dynamic similarity hypothesis, we found that the mass-specific cost of transport at experimentally measured optimal walking speed and Froude number were not equal across individuals, but retained a significant correlation with body mass. Overall, the effect of lower limb length on optimal walking speed was weak. These results suggest that the Froude number may not be an effective way for anthropologists to correct for size differences across individuals, but more studies are needed. We suggest that researchers first determine whether geometric similarity characterizes their data before making inferences based on the dynamic similarity hypothesis, and then check the consistency of their results with and without Froude number corrections before drawing any firm conclusions.

  abstract  = {The Dynamic Similarity Hypothesis (DSH) suggests that when animals of different size walk at similar Froude numbers (equal ratios of inertial and gravitational forces) they will use similar size-corrected gaits. This application of similarity theory to animal biomechanics has contributed to fundamental insights in the mechanics and evolution of a diverse set of locomotor systems. However, despite its popularity, many mammals fail to walk with dynamically similar stride lengths, a key element of gait that determines spontaneous speed and energy costs. Here, we show that the applicability of the DSH is dependent on the inertial forces examined. In general, the inertial forces are thought to be the centripetal force of the inverted pendulum model of stance phase, determined by the length of the limb. If instead we model inertial forces as the centripetal force of the limb acting as a suspended pendulum during swing phase (determined by limb center of mass position), the DSH for stride length variation is fully supported. Thus, the DSH shows that inter-specific differences in spatial kinematics are tied to the evolution of limb mass distribution patterns. Selection may act on morphology to produce a given stride length, or alternatively, stride length may be a “spandrel” of selection acting on limb mass distribution.},

  abstract  = {Understanding locomotor energetics is imperative, because energy expended during locomotion, a requisite feature of primate subsistence, is lost to reproduction. Although metabolic energy expenditure can only be measured in extant species, using the equations of motion to calculate mechanical energy expenditure offers unlimited opportunities to explore energy expenditure, particularly in extinct species on which empirical experimentation is impossible. Variability, either within or between groups, can manifest as changes in size and/or shape. Isometric scaling (or geometric similarity) requires that all dimensions change equally among all individuals, a condition that will not be met in naturally developing populations. The Froude number (Fr), with lower limb (or hindlimb) length as the characteristic length, has been used to compensate for differences in size, but does not account for differences in shape. To determine whether or not shape matters at the intraspecific level, we used a mechanical model that had properties that mimic human variation in shape. We varied crural index and limb segment circumferences (and consequently, mass and inertial parameters) among nine populations that included 19 individuals that were of different size. Our goal in the current work is to understand whether shape variation changes mechanical energy sufficiently enough to make shape a critical factor in mechanical and metabolic energy assessments. Our results reaffirm that size does not affect mass-specific mechanical cost of transport (Alexander and Jayes, 1983) among geometrically similar individuals walking at equal Fr. The known shape differences among modern humans, however, produce sufficiently large differences in internal and external work to account for much of the observed variation in metabolic energy expenditure, if mechanical energy is correlated with metabolic energy. Any species or other group that exhibits shape differences should be affected similarly to that which we establish for humans. Unfortunately, we currently do not have a simple method to control or adjust for size-shape differences in individuals that are not geometrically similar, although musculoskeletal modeling is a viable, and promising, alternative. In mouse-to-elephant comparisons, size differences could represent the largest source of morphological variation, and isometric scaling factors such as Fr can compensate for much of the variability. Within species, however, shape differences may dominate morphological variation and Fr is not designed to compensate for shape differences. In other words, those shape differences that are “reasonably close” at the mouse-to-elephant level may become grossly different for within-species energetic comparisons.},

This is due to physical principles (inferred in- and outvelocities around the joints, stride lengths) and also the observation that fast-moving animals tend to share a number of purported key features which are either absent or not developed to near the same extent in slower moving forms. Previous studies have shown hind limb length and metatarsus/femur ratio to be correlated significantly, albeit modestly with running speed. These studies have nearly all been bivariate analyses. Based on the physical principles, there is reason to suppose that more variables than just m/f ratio could be important as adaptations for fast locomotion, and also that bivariate analyses are too simple. In this study a sample of 76 running mammals was used, with running speeds taken from literature. A number of osteological parameters were discovered to covary significantly with peak running speed, albeit only modestly. Using the information from phylogeny reduced all correlations, often significantly so. Multivariate analyses resulted in markedly higher correlation coefficients. Animals probably do not optimize their anatomy for the purpose of running very fast, which occurs only on rare occasions, but for reducing costs of locomotion.},

We analysed 351 filmed sequences to assess the gallop type of 89 investigated mammalian species belonging to Carnivora, Artiodactyla and Perissodactyla orders. Twenty-three biometrical, ecological and physiological parameters were collected for each species both from literature data and from animal specimens. Most of the species showed only one kind of gallop: transverse (42%) or rotary (39%), while some species performed rotary gallop only at high speed (19%). In a factorial analysis, the first principal component (PC), which accounted for 40% of the total variance, was positively correlated to the relative speed and negatively correlated to size and body mass. The second PC was correlated to the ratio between distal and proximal limb segments. Large size and longer proximal limb segments were associated with transverse gallop, while rotary and speed-dependent species showed higher metacarpus/humerus and metatarsus/femur length ratio and faster relative speeds. The resulting limb excursion angles were proportional to the square-root of the Froude number, and significantly higher in rotary gallopers. The gait pattern analysis indicated significant differences between transverse and rotary gallop in forelimb and hindlimb duty factor (t-test; P&amp;lt;0.001), and in duration of the forelimb contact (t-test; P=0.045). Our results show that an exclusive gallop gait is adopted by a large number of mammalian species, and indicate that the gallop pattern depends on diverse environmental, morphometrical and biomechanical characters.},

  abstract  = {Analyses of how intralimb coordination during locomotion varies within and across different taxa are necessary for understanding the morphological and neurological basis for locomotion in general. Previous findings suggest that intralimb proportions are the major source of kinematic variation that governs intralimb coordination across taxa. Also, independence of kinematics from habitat preference and phylogenetic position has been suggested for mammals. This leads to the hypothesis that among equally sized bird species exhibiting equal limb proportions, similar kinematics can be observed. To test this hypothesis, the bipedal locomotion of two distantly related ground-dwelling bird species (Eudromia elegans and Coturnix coturnix) and of a less terrestrial species (Corvus monedula) was investigated by means of a biplanar high-speed X-ray videographic analysis. Birds exhibited similar intralimb proportions and were filmed over a broad range of speed while moving on a treadmill. Joint and limb element angles, as well as pelvic rotations, were quantified. Regarding fore-aft motions of the limb joints and elements, a congruent pattern of intralimb coordination was observed among all experimental species. The sample of species suggests that this is largely independent of their habitat preference and systematic position and seems to be related to demands for coping with an irregular terrain with a minimum of necessary control. Hence, the initial hypothesis was confirmed. However, this congruence is not found when looking at medio-lateral limb motions and pelvic rotations, showing distinct differences between ground-dwellers (e.g. largely restricted to a parasagittal plane) and C. monedula (e.g. increased mobility of the hip joint).},

Using simple planar models, we discuss how geometric constraints render joint and elevation angles independent of neither morphology, degree of crouch, nor one another during the stance phase of locomotion. The implicit null hypothesis of potential similarity is invalidated because angular data are not viably transferable among limbs of dissimilar proportion and/or degree of crouch. Overlooking or dismissing the effect of constraints on angular parameterization hampers efforts to quantitatively elucidate the evolution of locomotion. We advocate a search for alternative methods of measuring limb movement that can decouple intersegmental coordination from morphology and posture.},

  abstract  = {A comparative study of quantitative kinematic data of fore- and hindlimb movements of eight different mammalian species leads to the recognition of basic principles in the locomotion of small therians. The description of kinematics comprises fore- and hindlimb movements as well as sagittal spine movements including displacement patterns of limb segments, their contribution to step length, and joint movements. The comparison of the contributions of different segments to step length clearly shows the proximal parts (scapula, femur) to produce more than half of the propulsive movement of the whole limb at symmetrical gaits. Basically, a three-segmented limb with zigzag configuration of segments is mainly displaced at the scapular pivot or hip joint, both of which have the same vertical distance to the ground. Two segments operate in matched motion during retraction of the limb. While kinematic parameters of forelimbs are independent of speed and gait (with the scapula as the dominant element), fundamental changes occur in hindlimb kinematics with the change from symmetrical to in-phase gaits. Forward motion of the hindlimbs is now mainly due to sagittal lumbar spine movements contributing to half of the step length. Kinematics of small therian mammals are independent of their systematic position, their natural habitat, and also of specific anatomical dispositions (e.g. reduction of fingers, toes, or clavicle). In contrast, the possession of a tail influences `pelvic movements&#039;.},

  abstract  = {Human erect locomotion is unique among living primates. Evolution selected specific biomechanical features that make human locomotion mechanically efficient. These features are matched by the motor patterns generated in the CNS. What happens when humans walk with bent postures? Are normal motor patterns of erect locomotion maintained or completely reorganized? Five healthy volunteers walked straight and forward at different speeds in three different postures (regular, knee-flexed, and knee- and trunk-flexed) while their motion, ground reaction forces, and electromyographic (EMG) activity were recorded. The three postures imply large differences in the position of the center of body mass relative to the body segments. The elevation angles of the trunk, pelvis, and lower limb segments relative to the vertical in the sagittal plane, the ground reaction forces and the rectified EMGs were analyzed over the gait cycle. The waveforms of the elevation angles along the gait cycle remained essentially unchanged irrespective of the adopted postures. The first two harmonics of these kinematic waveforms explain >95\% of their variance. The phase shift but not the amplitude ratio between the first harmonic of the elevation angle waveforms of adjacent pairs was affected systematically by changes in posture. Thigh, shank, and foot angles covaried close to a plane in all conditions, but the plane orientation was systematically different in bent versus erect locomotion. This was explained by the changes in the temporal coupling among the three segments. For walking speeds >1 m s−1, the plane orientation of bent locomotion indicates a much lower mechanical efficiency relative to erect locomotion. Ground reaction forces differed prominently in bent versus erect posture displaying characteristics intermediate between those typical of walking and those of running. Mean EMG activity was greater in bent postures for all recorded muscles independent of the functional role. The waveforms of the muscle activities and muscle synergies also were affected by the adopted posture. We conclude that maintaining bent postures does not interfere either with the generation of segmental kinematic waveforms or with the planar constraint of intersegmental covariation. These characteristics are maintained at the expense of adjustments in kinetic parameters, muscle synergies and the temporal coupling among the oscillating body segments. We argue that an integrated control of gait and posture is made possible because these two motor functions share some common principles of spatial organization.},

  abstract  = {To describe and help interpret joint movements in various forms of primate locomotion, we explored the use of Fourier analysis to represent changing joint angles as a series of sine and cosine curves added together to approximate the raw angular data. Results are presented for four joints (shoulder, elbow, hip and knee) with emphasis on the shoulder, and for five types of locomotion (catarhine primate quadrupedal walking, human hands-and-feet creeping and hands-and-knees creeping, and human walking and running). Fourier analysis facilitates functional interpretation of the angles of all four joints, by providing average joint angles and an indication of the number of peaks and troughs in the angular data. The description of limb movements also afforded us the opportunity to compare human and other catarhine joint angles, and we interpret the Fourier results in terms of locomotor posture and type. In addition, the shoulder data are useful for determination of some aspects of interlimb coordination. Non-human primates walking quadrupedally and humans creeping on hands and knees generally evince diagonal couplets interlimb coordination, in which the hand on one side strikes the substrate at about the same time as the contralateral foot or knee. Furthermore, human walking and running seem to follow a similar pattern, as indicated by Fourier analysis. From our data it is concluded that human bipedal gaits are qualitatively similar to diagonal couplets gaits in other primates, but quite different from the lateral couplets gaits used by many non-primate mammals. A number of other benefits of Fourier analysis in primate locomotion studies are also discussed. These include the ability to make statistical comparisons among various types of limb movements in a wide variety of species, a simple archival technique for limb movement data, and a greater understanding of the variability of locomotor movements.},

  abstract  = {Objective. To examine the effects of pregnancy on the coordination of transverse pelvic and thoracic rotations during gait. Design. Gait of healthy pregnant women and nulligravidae was studied during treadmill walking at predetermined velocities ranging from 0.17 to 1.72 m/s. Background. Pelvis–thorax coordination during walking is altered in women with postpartum pregnancy-related pelvic girdle pain. This coordination has not been investigated in a healthy pregnant population. Methods. Comfortable walking velocity was established. Amplitudes of pelvic and thoracic rotations were calculated. Their coordination was characterized by relative Fourier phase and its standard deviation. Results. Comfortable walking velocity was significantly reduced. The amplitudes of pelvic and thoracic rotations were somewhat reduced, with significantly smaller intra-individual standard deviations. Also pelvis–thorax relative Fourier phase was somewhat smaller, its intra-individual standard deviation was negatively correlated with week of pregnancy, and significantly lower at velocities ⩾1.06 m/s. Conclusions. The general pattern of gait kinematics in pregnant women is very similar to that of nulligravidae. Still, it appears that pregnant women experience difficulties in realizing the more anti-phase pelvis–thorax coordination that is required at higher walking velocities. Relevance The present study shows that gait in healthy pregnancy is remarkably normal, but some differences in pelvis–thorax coordination were detected. In healthy pregnancy, anti-phase pelvis–thorax coordination appears difficult, but less so than in pregnancy-related pelvic girdle pain. Better understanding of gait in healthy pregnancy may provide insight into the gait problems of women with pregnancy-related pelvic girdle pain.},

  abstract  = {Although lizards have been model organisms for testing locomotor performance and in ecomorphological studies, the limb movements of lizards during high-speed locomotion are poorly understood. Thus, we quantified the three-dimensional kinematics of the hindlimb, body and tail for five morphologically distinct species of lizard during steady-speed locomotion near maximum sprinting speed (2-5 m s-1). The kinematics of different species had little multivariate overlap. More than half of the strides of all species had digitigrade foot posture, but the frequency of using digitigrade foot posture varied among species. The combination of digitigrade foot posture and large foot size of the lizards contributed substantially to the high values of hip height. For each species, different suites of kinematic variables distinguished bipedal from quadrupedal strides. Interspecific morphological variation did not correspond globally to variation in kinematics, although lizard species with elongated hindlimbs took longer strides than species with shorter hindlimbs. The Froude numbers and relative stride lengths of all lizards running near maximal speeds were large compared with those reported previously for other vertebrates.},

In an intact organism the length of a muscle is in its turn a function of the angle of articulation α. The chapter discusses integrity and structural complexity of live movements. Co-ordination is an activity which guarantees that a movement shall have the homogeneity, integration and structural unity. This activity is principally based not on particular processes in individual neurons, but on the determinate organization of their common activity. This organization must necessarily be reflected in the anatomical plan in the form of localization.},

Ten sites in the front limb and 8 in the hind limb were investigated. In the distal parts of the limbs a linear relationship with the angle of the adjacent joint was found. The more complex pattern in the proximal parts of the limbs could be satisfactorily represented by truncated Fourier series. Analyses were principally done in the Dutch Warmblood horse, but investigations in other breeds were carried out to verify the general applicability of the models. Skin displacement appeared to be negligible in the lower parts of the limbs, but reached large values in proximally located sites such as the caudal part of the greater trochanter of the femur. It is concluded that skin displacement in equine gait analysis may account for major errors in applied biomechanical research and therefore should be corrected, although it may be of less importance for clinical applications.},

  abstract  = {Abstract Vertical climbing has played an important role in theories about the evolution of habitual bipedalism in early hominids and of locomotor specialization in hominoids. However, empirical data on vertical climbing in nonhuman primates are scarce, especially regarding kinematics. In this paper, the kinematics of flexed-elbow vertical climbing of four hominoid species are reported: western lowland gorillas (Gorilla gorilla gorilla), bonobos (Pan paniscus), Sumatran orangutans (Pongo pygmaeus abelii), and yellow-cheeked crested gibbons (Hylobates concolor gabriellae). The climbing sequences were recorded simultaneously by four digital video cameras in European zoos. Analyzed parameters include intersegmental flexion/extension angles of the shoulder, elbow, hip, and knee joints, horizontal abduction/adduction angles of the upper arm and thigh, and distance of the body center of gravity from the substrate. Analyses reveal that differences in climbing kinematics between individuals of different age/sex classes of one species are mostly size-related, whereas interspecific differences reflect specific locomotor adaptations. The climbing kinematics of bonobos and gorillas are more similar to each other than to those of orangutans or gibbons. The range of motion of the major limb joints in adult orangutans is larger than in African apes, although the hip is not more extended. Gibbons horizontally abduct the arm more and the thigh less during climbing than any of the great apes. These results allow us to question some qualitative descriptions of vertical climbing kinematics reported in the literature, and to discuss implications for the evolution of locomotor adaptations in hominoids.

  abstract  = {The pectoral girdle and fore limb of Equus and Dasypus are compared. It is shown that the shoulder muscles of the horse have a small mechanical advantage (1/13 for the m. teres major) and are therefore adapted to produce rapid movements of the limb; these muscles in the armadillo have a larger mechanical advantage (1/4 for the m. teres) to produce slower movements, while exerting a greater force. The broad scapulae and short legs of fossorial mammals are adaptations producing powerful movements of the foot, usually with strong abductor action. Aquatic mammals show similar modifications, though without the emphasis on abductor movements. The high, narrow senpulac and long legs of crvsorial inanimals are esplained as adaptations to speed, though the detailed arrangements by which this is achieved differ in cursorial ungulates and carnivores. The sharp angles at the ends of the vertebral border of the scapula in cursorial ungulates provide pints of insertion for two parts of the m. serratus, which act as antagonists in the fore-and-aft movement of the shoulder. Similarly in the dog, and probably all cursorial carnivores and lagomorphs, the sharp vertebro-axillary angle affords a point of insertion for the posterior digitations of the m. serratus. The mechanical adaptations of the olecranon process and the m. triceps are described. The structure of the vertebral column and axial musculature is shown to depend upon gait. Two types of gallop, the horse gallop and leaping gallop (e.g. dog) are analysed and the association between gait and structure described. The mechanics of gaits are discussed in an appendix. The extensor muscles from the pelvis to the femur fall into two groups, an iliac group adapted to rapid extension of the thigh, and an ischio-pubic group adapted to slower but more powerful thigh extension. The relative proportions of the two regions of the pelvis vary according to the gaits adopted. In cursorial ungulates the ilium is long and the ischio-pubic region short, whereas in aquatic mammals the latter region predominates. The lengths and cross-sectional areas of the bones of the hind limb are shown to be correlated with gait in aquatic, cursorial (leaping gallop and horse gallop), saltatorial and graviportal mammals.},

Kinetic and potential energy, lost at one stage of a stride, is stored temporarily as elastic strain energy and returned later in an elastic recoil. At high speeds, men and kangaroos seem to save in this way more than half the metabolic energy they would otherwise need for locomotion.It is shown by means of a generalized model that muscles and tendons could both be important as elastic energy stores. Analysis of films and force records of kangaroos hopping shows that strain energy stored while the feet are on the ground must be stored mainly distal to the knee. The principal muscles there have short fibres, and most of the storage must be in tendons. Investigation of camels shows that tendons in the feet, distal to the ankle and wrist, are especially important. The scope for elastic storage while the feet are off the groundis also considered.Though the evidence presented in this paper comes mainly from a few species, the conclusions presumably apply to large mammals in general.},

  abstract  = {Abstract Convergent evolution has played an important role in the development of the ecological niche concept. We investigated patterns of convergent and divergent evolution of Caribbean Anolis lizards. These lizards diversified independently on each of the islands of the Greater Antilles, producing the same set of habitat specialists on each island. Using a phylogenetic comparative framework, we examined patterns of morphological convergence in five functionally distinct sets of morphological characters: body size, body shape, head shape, lamella number, and sexual size dimorphism. We find evidence for convergence among members of the habitat specialist types for each of these five datasets. Furthermore, the patterns of convergence differ among at least four of the five datasets; habitat specialists that are similar for one set of characters are often greatly different for another. This suggests that the habitat specialist niches into which these anoles have evolved are multidimensional, involving several distinct and independent aspects of morphology.},

  abstract  = {Phylogenetic signal is the tendency for closely related species to display similar trait values due to their common ancestry. Several methods have been developed for quantifying phylogenetic signal in univariate traits and for sets of traits treated simultaneously, and the statistical properties of these approaches have been extensively studied. However, methods for assessing phylogenetic signal in high-dimensional multivariate traits like shape are less well developed, and their statistical performance is not well characterized. In this article, I describe a generalization of the K statistic of Blomberg et al. that is useful for quantifying and evaluating phylogenetic signal in highly dimensional multivariate data. The method (Kmult) is found from the equivalency between statistical methods based on covariance matrices and those based on distance matrices. Using computer simulations based on Brownian motion, I demonstrate that the expected value of Kmult remains at 1.0 as trait variation among species is increased or decreased, and as the number of trait dimensions is increased. By contrast, estimates of phylogenetic signal found with a squared-change parsimony procedure for multivariate data change with increasing trait variation among species and with increasing numbers of trait dimensions, confounding biological interpretations. I also evaluate the statistical performance of hypothesis testing procedures based on Kmult and find that the method displays appropriate Type I error and high statistical power for detecting phylogenetic signal in high-dimensional data. Statistical properties of Kmult were consistent for simulations using bifurcating and random phylogenies, for simulations using different numbers of species, for simulations that varied the number of trait dimensions, and for different underlying models of trait covariance structure. Overall these findings demonstrate that Kmult provides a useful means of evaluating phylogenetic signal in high-dimensional multivariate traits. Finally, I illustrate the utility of the new approach by evaluating the strength of phylogenetic signal for head shape in a lineage of Plethodon salamanders.},

  abstract  = {Phylogenetic Principal Components Analysis (pPCA) is a recently proposed method for ordinating multivariate data in a way that takes into account the phylogenetic non-independence among species means. We review this method in terms of geometric morphometric shape analysis and compare its properties to ordinary principal components analysis (PCA). We find that pPCA produces a shape space that preserves the Procrustes distances between objects, that allows shape models to be constructed, and that produces scores that can be used as shape variables for most purposes. Unlike ordinary PCA scores, however, the scores on pPC axes are correlated with one another and their variances do not correspond to the eigenvalues of the phylogenetically corrected axes. The pPC axes are oriented by the non-phylogenetic component of shape variation, but the positioning of the scores in the space retains phylogenetic covariance making the visual information presented in plots a hybrid of non-phylogenetic and phylogenetic. Presuming that all pPCA scores are used as shape variables, there is no difference between them and PCA scores for the construction of distance-based trees (such as UPGMA), for morphological disparity, or for ordinary multivariate statistical analyses (so long as the algorithms are suitable for correlated variables). pPCA scores yield different trait-based trees (such as maximum likelihood trees for continuous traits) because the scores are correlated and because the pPC axes differ from PC axes. pPCA eigenvalues represent the residual shape variance once the phylogenetic covariance has been removed (though there are scaling issues), and as such they provide information on covariance that is independent of phylogeny. Tests for modularity on pPCA eigenvalues will therefore yield different results than ordinary PCA eigenvalues. pPCA can be considered another tool in the kit of geometric morphometrics, but one whose properties are more difficult to interpret than ordinary PCA.},

  abstract  = {For phylogenetically diverse mammals, ranging from small rodents to large ungulates, the generalization that limb erectness increases with increased size is supported by some size-dependent scaling relationships of appendicular skeletal anatomy as well as a limited number of direct observations of limb posture during locomotion. If size alone is the causal basis for different limb posture, then the erectness of limbs should increase significantly with increased size within a phylogenetically narrow lineage, but such data are sparse. Thus, to better establish the correlation between size and posture of mammalian limbs, we quantified the scaling relationships between mass and limb dimensions and kinematics during walking of nine species within the felid (cat) clade, which has qualitatively similar limb design. We studied the domestic cat, serval, ocelot, lynx, leopard, cheetah, cougar, lion and tiger, which had masses ranging from &amp;lt;4 kg to nearly 200 kg. Apart from variation associated with overall size, the lengths of the appendicular skeletal structures of most of the felid species were morphologically very similar in multivariate space. The kinematics of the limbs were also relatively uniform, and size had little predictive value for limb posture among felid species. Only three out of a total of 24 angular variables at footfall and midstance changed significantly (0.02&amp;lt;P&amp;lt;0.05) with increased mass. Thus, in contrast to previous broadly comparative studies of mammals, larger species of felids did not have more upright limbs than smaller species.},

  abstract  = {The crouched limb posture of small mammals enables them to react to unexpected irregularities in the support. Small arboreal primates would benefit from these kinematics in their arboreal habitat but it has been demonstrated that primates display certain differences in forelimb kinematics to other mammals. The objective of this paper is to find out whether these changes in forelimb kinematics are related to changes in body size and limb proportions. As primates descended from small ancestors, a comparison between living small primates and other small mammals makes it possible to determine the polarity of character transformations for kinematic and morphometric features proposed to be unique to primates. Walking kinematics of mouse lemurs, brown lemurs, cotton-top tamarins and squirrel monkeys was investigated using cineradiography. Morphometry was conducted on a sample of 110 mammals comprising of primates, marsupials, rodents and carnivores. It has been shown that forelimb kinematics change with increasing body size in such a way that limb protraction increases but retraction decreases. Total forelimb excursion, therefore, is almost independent of body size. Kinematic changes are linked to changes in forelimb proportions towards greater asymmetry between scapula and radius. Due to the spatial restriction inherent in the diagonal footfall sequence of primates, forelimb excursion is influenced by the excursion of the elongated hind limb. Hindlimb geometry, however, is highly conserved, as has been previously shown. The initial changes in forelimb kinematics might, therefore, be explained as solutions to a constraint rather than as adaptations to the particular demands of arboreal locomotion.},

Data were based on video recordings (50 Hz) of nine subjects in a lateral view, walking at voluntary speed. The major differences between bipedal and quadrupedal walking are found in the trunk, thigh, and hip angles. During bipedal walking, the trunk is approximately 33?41° more erect than during quadrupedal locomotion, although it is considerably more bent forward than in normal human locomotion. Moreover, during bipedal walking, the hip has a smaller range of motion (by 12°) and is more extended (by 20?35°) than during quadrupedal walking. In general, angle profiles in bonobos are much more variable than in humans. Intralimb phase relationships of subsequent joint angles show that hip-knee coordination is similar for bipedal and quadrupedal walking, and resembles the human pattern. The coordination between knee and ankle differs much more from the human pattern. Based on joint angles observed throughout stance phase and on the estimation of functional leg length, an efficient inverted pendulum mechanism is not expected in bonobos.},

By parameterization we mean a quantitative expression of certain gait descriptors as the function of an external parameter, such as the ground slope. The mathematical quantities derived from the geometric features of the hip-knee cyclograms are the main gait descriptors considered in this study. We demonstrate that these descriptors, expressed in a general setting as the geometric moments of the cyclogram contours, can meaningfully reflect the evolution of the gait kinematics on different slopes. We provide a new interpretation of the cyclogram perimeter and discover two potential invariants of slope-walking gait. Experimental slope-walking data obtained at 1° interval within the range of −13 to +13° (±23.1%) on a variable-inclination treadmill was used in this study. The parameterization procedure presented here is general in nature and may be employed without restriction to any closed curve such as the phase diagram, the moment-angle diagram, and the velocity–velocity curves of human gait. The technique may be utilized for the quantitative characterization of normal gait, global comparison of two different gaits, clinical identification of pathological conditions and for the tracking of progress of patients under rehabilitation program.},

This vertical reference can be estimated using multisensory information, amongst others visual cues play a role. In the past it was already shown that visual deprivation and/or perturbation of visual information largely affect gait kinematics. The goal of this study is to investigate the impact of visual deprivation on intra-limb movement coordination. Children aged between 3 and 11 years and young adults are included in this study to investigate age-related differences in the visual control of locomotion. Intersegmental coordination was tested under two different conditions: full vision (FV) and no vision (NV). Heading direction and walking speed were taken into account. A significant interaction effect was observed between visual condition and age for walking speed. Between age groups, no differences are observed in the FV condition but in the NV condition children walk significantly slower than adults. This shows that the relative importance of visual information is age dependent. Between age groups significant differences were found in heading direction. Coordination was characterized using the planar covariation technique, by constructing thigh versus shank and shank versus foot angle--angle plots and by cross-correlation function analysis. Regardless of the presence or absence of visual information, the planarity index remains high, indicating that the laws of planar covariation hold in the absence of visual afferent information. On the other hand, the shape of the gait loop does show significant differences between FV and NV conditions. Changes in the shape of the gait loop are primarily determined by changes in the coupling between the thigh and shank elevation angles. The coupling between the shank and foot elevation angles is dependent upon walking speed and does not differ between FV and NV conditions. Between age groups significant differences are observed in covariation plane orientation.},

  abstract  = {Broad allometric studies of the musculoskeletal system have frequently sought to explain how locomotor variables have been influenced by body mass. To examine animals that vary widely in body mass, these studies have included taxa that differ in their locomotor adaptations and phylogenetic relatedness. Because these sources of diversity could obscure the effects of body mass, this study was designed to test the effects of adaptive differences in limb proportions and phylogeny, as well as body mass, on locomotor kinematics and extensor muscle mechanical advantage. More specifically, two hypotheses were tested in a sample of closely related animals: (i) that, among animals with similar body mass, those with longer limb segments should adopt more extended limb postures to moderate the joint and midshaft bending moments that they experience, and (ii) that body mass will have similar influences on joint posture and joint moments in closely related and diverse mammalian samples. Three-dimensional kinematic and synchronous force-platform data were collected for six individual cercopithecine monkeys ranging in mass from 4kg to 24kg and at a range of walking speeds. Comparisons among three monkeys with similar body mass but different limb segment lengths reveal a significant effect of limb proportion on posture. That is, animals with longer limbs frequently use more extended limb postures and can have correspondingly lower joint moments. The scaling of locomotor variables across the entire sample of closely related monkeys was generally similar to published results for a diverse sample of mammals, with larger monkeys having more extended limb postures, lower joint moments and greater effective mechanical advantage (EMA) for their limb extensor musculature. Ankle EMA, however, did not increase with body mass in the primate sample, suggesting that clade-specific adaptive differences (e.g. the use of arboreal supports by primates) may constrain the effects of body mass.},

Subjects walked at different, freely chosen speeds ranging from 0.9 to 2.1 m s-1, while motion and ground reaction forces on the right side of the body were recorded in three-dimensional space. 2. The time course of the anatomical angles of flexion-extension at the hip and ankle was variable not only across subjects, but even from trial to trial in the same subject. By contrast, the time course of the changes in the angles of elevation of each limb segment (pelvis, thigh, shank and foot) relative to the vertical was stereotyped across subjects. 3. To compare the waveforms across speeds, data were scaled in time relative to gait cycle duration. The pattern of ground reaction forces was highly speed dependent. Several distinct families of curves could be recognized in the flexion-extension angles at the hip and ankle. Instead, the waveforms of global length and elevation of the limb, elevation angles of all limb segments and flexion-extension at the knee were invariant with speed. 4. When gait trajectories at all speeds are plotted in the position space defined by the elevation angles of the limb segments, they describe regular loops on a plane. The statistical characteristics of these angular covariations were quantified by means of principal component analysis. The first two principal components accounted together for > 99\% of the total experimental variance, and were quantitatively comparable in all subjects. 5. This constraint of planar covariation of the elevation angles is closely reminiscent of that previously described for the control of posture. The existence of laws of intersegmental co-ordination, common to the control of posture and locomotion, presumably assures the maintenance of dynamic equilibrium during forward progression, and the anticipatory adaptation to potentially destabilizing factors by means of co-ordinated kinematic synergies of the whole body.},

Both unrestrained as well as steady-state locomotion was analyzed. Spatio-temporal gait parameters, data on interlimb coordination, and limb kinematics are reported. Two-toed sloths displayed great variability in spatio-temporal gait parameters over the observed range of speeds. They increase speed by decreasing the durations of contact and swing phases, as well as by increasing step length. Gait utilization also varies with no strict gait sequence or interlimb timing evident in slow movements, but a tendency to employ diagonal sequence, diagonal couplet gaits in fast movements. In contrast, limb kinematics were highly conserved with respect to ‘normal’ pronograde locomotion. Limb element and joint angles at touch down and lift off, element and joint excursions, and contribution to body progression of individual elements are similar to those reported for non-cursorial mammals of small to medium size. Hands and feet are specialized to maintain firm connection to supports, and do not contribute to step length or progression. In so doing, the tarsometatarsus lost its role as an individual propulsive element during the evolution of suspensory locomotion. Conservative kinematic behavior of the remaining limb elements does not preclude that muscle recruitment and neuromuscular control for limb pro- and retraction are also conserved. The observed kinematic patterns of two-toed sloths improve our understanding of the convergent evolution of quadrupedal suspensory posture and locomotion in the two extant sloth lineages.},

  abstract  = {In human bipedal walking, temporal changes in the elevation angle of the thigh, shank and foot segments covary to form a regular loop within a single plane in three-dimensional space. In this study, we quantified the planar covariation of limb elevation angles during bipedal locomotion in common quails to test whether the degree of planarity and the orientation of the covariance plane differ between birds, humans and Japanese macaques as reported in published accounts. Five quails locomoted on a treadmill and were recorded by a lateral X-ray fluoroscopy. The elevation angle of the thigh, shank and foot segments relative to the vertical axis was calculated and compared with published data on human and macaque bipedal locomotion. The results showed that the planar covariation applied to quail bipedal locomotion and planarity was stronger in quails than in humans. The orientation of the covariation plane in quails differed from that in humans, and was more similar to the orientation of the covariation plane in macaques. Although human walking is characterized by vaulting mechanics of the body center of mass, quails and macaques utilize spring-like running mechanics even though the duty factor is &amp;gt;0.5. Therefore, differences in the stance leg mechanics between quails and humans may underlie the difference in the orientation of the covariation plane. The planar covariation of inter-segmental coordination has evolved independently in both avian and human locomotion, despite the different mechanical constraints.},

  abstract  = {To study intersegmental coordination in humans performing different locomotor tasks (backward, normal, fast walking, and running), we analyzed the spatiotemporal patterns of both elevation and joint angles bilaterally in the sagittal plane. In particular, we determined the origins of the planar covariation of foot, shank, and thigh elevation angles. This planar constraint is observable in the three-dimensional space defined by these three angles and corresponds to the plane described by the three time-varying elevation angle variables over each step cycle. Previous studies showed that this relation between elevation angles constrains lower limb coordination in various experimental situations. We demonstrate here that this planar covariation mainly arises from the strong correlation between foot and shank elevation angles, with thigh angle independently contributing to the pattern of intersegmental covariation. We conclude that the planar covariation of elevation angles does not reflect central constraints, as previously suggested. An alternative approach for analyzing the patterns of coordination of both elevation and joint (hip, knee, and ankle) angles is used, based on temporal cross-correlation and phase relationships between pairs of kinematic variables. We describe the changes in the pattern of intersegmental coordination that are associated with the changes of locomotor modes and locomotor speeds. We provide some evidence for a distinct control of thigh motion and discuss the respective contributions of passive mechanical factors and of active (arising from neural control) factors to the formation and the regulation of the locomotor pattern throughout the gait cycle.},

  abstract  = {Leg segment rotations in human walking covary, so that the three-dimensional trajectory of temporal changes in the elevation angles lies close to a plane. Recently the role of central versus biomechanical constraints on the kinematics control of human locomotion has been questioned. Here we show, based on both modeling and experimental data, that the planar law of intersegmental coordination is not a simple consequence of biomechanics. First, the full limb behavior in various locomotion modes (walking on inclined surface, staircase stepping, air-stepping, crouched walking, hopping) can be expressed as 2 degrees of freedom planar motion even though the orientation of the plane and pairwise segment angle correlations may differ substantially. Second, planar covariation is not an inevitable outcome of any locomotor movement. It can be systematically violated in some conditions (e.g., when stooping and grasping an object on the floor during walking or in toddlers at the onset of independent walking) or transferred into a simple linear relationship in others (e.g., during stepping in place). Finally, all three major limb segments contribute importantly to planar covariation and its characteristics resulting in a certain endpoint trajectory defined by the limb axis length and orientation. Recent advances in the neural control of movement support the hypothesis about central representation of kinematics components.},

  abstract  = {Anticipatory locomotor adjustments (ALAs) are used during locomotion to perform tasks, such as obstacle clearance, although not much is known as to how these ALAs are implemented by the central nervous system (CNS). The current study applied the planar law of intersegmental coordination to both leading and trailing limbs in a paradigm in which obstacle height and depth were manipulated to propose how ALAs are controlled. Ten healthy young adults stepped over nine obstacle conditions. Full-body 3D kinematic data were collected and elevation angles of the foot, shank, and thigh in the sagittal plane were calculated. For each limb within each trial, a principal component analysis was applied to limb segment trajectories. As well, a Fourier harmonic series was used to represent segment elevation angle trajectories, and phase differences between adjacent segments were determined. Planarity was consistently high in both limbs for all obstacle conditions, although significant differences between obstacle heights were observed. Increases in covariance loop width and rotation of the covariance plane accompanied changes in planarity. As observed in previous studies, fundamental harmonic phase differences between adjacent segments were highly correlated to plane characteristics and these phase differences changed systematically with increases in obstacle height. From the results, it is proposed that if a given environment requires a change in locomotion, the CNS adjusts a basic locomotor pattern if needed through the manipulation of the phase differences in the fundamental harmonics of the elevation angles between adjacent segments and elevation angle amplitude (with a constraint being intersegmenal elevation angle planarity).},

  abstract  = {Although the rat has become the favourite animal model in preclinical research on locomotion, studies designed to assess the strategy used by rats to avoid obstacle are lacking. Using an optoelectronic 3D motion analysis system, we therefore, compared the step pattern, timing and length variables of locomotor cycles, trajectories and joint angles of limbs when rats step between and over obstacles (3cm-high) fixed on a treadmill belt (25cm/s). Motion in all four limbs of adult animals with an initial age of 11 weeks was serially recorded for a period of 10 weeks. The results showed that obstacle clearance is associated with the reorganization of the basic step pattern resulting in increased stride length of all limbs, increased duration of the swing phase of the hindlimbs only, and the appearance of two quadrupedal stance phases. They also revealed that the elevation of limbs above the obstacle not only involves flexion but also displacement of the corresponding girdles. Remarkably, the trajectory of the trailing forelimb to get over the obstacle is almost a mirror image of the trajectory of the leading forelimb. Lastly, all of the parameters measured remained stable over the observation period during which body weight gain reached 100g (one third of the initial body weight). In conclusion, our study may provide a basis for future studies aimed at understanding the neural pathways involved in pathologies associated with deficit/recovery of challenged locomotion in rats.},

However, this has not been tested extensively among lizards, especially geckos. Most studies of gecko locomotion have focused on the ability to adhere to surfaces. However, there are several species of geckos that have either secondarily lost adhesive capabilities or simply lack the capability. We quantified the three-dimensional locomotor kinematics for two desert-dwelling padless geckos, Teratoscincus scincus and Eublepharis macularius, on a level trackway over a range of speeds. Our results indicate that T. scincus landed with a high relative hip height of 48.7±2.4% of total limb length at footfall, while E. macularius exhibited hip heights averaging only 36.0±1.8% of total limb length for footfall. The three-dimensional knee angle of T. scincus averaged 120.6±3.9° at footfall, while E. macularius averaged only 101.6±1.8° at footfall. In addition, the femur of E. macularius was elevated to a much greater extent (i.e., was closer to being perpendicular to the long axis of the body) than that of T. scincus and every other lizard that has been studied, suggesting they move with a “hyper-sprawled” posture. Both of these gecko species live in deserts, but T. scincus is psammophilic while E. macularius inhabits a rocky, more densely vegetated environment. Benefits of the more upright posture of T. scincus on open sandy habitat may include a greater field of view and more efficient locomotion. The more sprawled posture of E. macularius may lower its center of gravity and aid in balance while climbing on rocks or shrubs.},

The first part can be pursued in the laboratory but the second part is best accomplished in the field.

However, the role of behaviour in this ecomorphological paradigm is not well defined. We investigated the relationship between morphology, ecology and escape behaviour among 25 species of the lizard clade Liolaemus in a phylogenetic framework. We demonstrate that the relationship between morphology and characteristics of habitat structure shows little or no association, consistent with a previous study on this group. However, a significant relationship was found between morphology and escape behaviour with the distance a lizard moved from a potential predator correlated with body width, axilla-groin length, and pelvis width. A significant relationship between escape behaviour and habitat structure occupation was found; lizards that occupied tree trunks and open ground ran longer distances from predators and were found greater distances from shelter. Behavioural strategies used by these lizards in open habitats appear to have made unnecessary the evolution of limb morphology that has occurred in other lizards from other clades that are found in open settings. Understanding differences in patterns of ecomorphological relationships among clades is an important component for studying adaptive diversification.},

  abstract  = {A reanalysis of locomotor data from functional, energetic, mechanical and ecological perspectives reveals that limb posture has major effects on limb biomechanics, energy-saving mechanisms and the costs of locomotion. Regressions of data coded by posture (crouched vs. erect) reveal nonlinear patterns in metabolic cost, limb muscle mass, effective mechanical advantage, and stride characteristics. In small crouched animals energy savings from spring and pendular mechanisms are inconsequential and thus the metabolic cost of locomotion is driven by muscle activation costs. Stride frequency appears to be the principal functional parameter related to the decreasing cost of locomotion in crouched animals. By contrast, the shift to erect limb postures invoked a series of correlated effects on the metabolic cost of locomotion: effective mechanical advantage increases, relative muscle masses decrease, metapodial limb segments elongate dramatically (as limbs shift from digitigrade to unguligrade designs) and biological springs increase in size and effectiveness. Each of these factors leads to decreases in the metabolic cost of locomotion in erect forms resulting from real and increasing contributions of pendular savings and spring savings. Comparisons of the relative costs and ecological relevance of different gaits reveal that running is cheaper than walking in smaller animals up to the size of dogs but running is more expensive than walking in horses. Animals do not necessarily use their cheapest gaits for their predominant locomotor activity. Therefore, locomotor costs are driven more by ecological relevance than by the need to optimize locomotor economy.},

  abstract  = {It seems reasonable that quadrupeds should change gait from a walk to a trot to a gallop in such a way as to minimize their energy consumption, as human beings are known1 to change from a walk to a run at a particular speed (2.4 m s−1) below which walking requires less energy than running and above which the opposite is true. Thus by changing gait, human beings keep the energy cost of locomotion to a minimum as their speed increases. One reason this relation holds is that in humans, metabolic rate increases curvilinearly with walking speed1. If metabolism were a curvilinear function of speed within each of the gaits used by quadrupeds, it would support the hypothesis that they also change gait to minimize energetic cost. There is an old controversy about whether metabolic rate increases linearly or curvilinearly in running humans1,2 but all previous reports have suggested that metabolic rate increases linearly with speed in quadrupeds. Extended gaits were an important experimental tool in the study of human gait changes; thus we have trained three small horses (110-170 kg) to walk, trot and gallop on a motorized treadmill, and to extend their gaits on command. We report here that, using measurements of rates of oxygen consumption as an indicator of rates of energy consumption, we have confirmed that the natural gait at any speed indeed entails the smallest possible energy expenditure.},

Abstract Field metabolic rates and daily movement distances were measured in 26 individual kit foxes (Vulpes macrotis) over a 29?mo period in the southern Mojave Desert of California. Kit foxes traveled long distances (up to 32 km d?1), with males usually traveling farther than females. Daily movement distances were affected by season, since males traveled the greatest distances in spring and females traveled farthest in summer. Individual foxes tracked multiple times demonstrated repeatability of daily movement distance between nights, between summer and winter, and between consecutive winters. The field cost of activity per unit distance was estimated as 15.6 kJ km?1 from the partial regression coefficient of a multiple linear regression model, a value not significantly different from the incremental cost of locomotion derived from laboratory measurements. The field cost of activity was not affected by season, despite the expectation of higher costs of activity in the winter with increased thermoregulatory expenditure.

  abstract  = {Summary 1 Most studies of animal movements and habitat selection do not recognize empirically that different components of the environment are important to animals at different scales. Often, availability of habitats is defined at one or more arbitrary spatio-temporal scales, but use of those habitats is constrained to one scale. Identification of scalar movement is the first step in developing models to explain why animals select or move to certain parts of their range. We used a non-linear curve-fitting model of movement rates to identify discontinuities in the scales of movement by woodland caribou Rangifer tarandus caribou collared with global positioning system (GPS) collars. 2 We differentiated intrapatch from interpatch movements, but were unable to distinguish interpatch from migratory-type movements for most combinations of individual caribou by season. Model fit was stronger for winter than summer movements. We suggest that increased patch heterogeneity during the winter resulted in interseason variation in movements and corresponding model fit. 3 Responses by caribou to the environment were scale-dependent. When we applied logistic regressions, land-cover type, energetic costs of movement, and predation risk differentiated the two scales of movement. Intrapatch movements had a lower cost of movement, were associated with cover types where foraging behaviours probably occurred, and were closer to areas of higher predator risk than interpatch movements. 4 Application of the non-linear model will aid in developing mechanism-based approaches to studying resource selection and animal behaviour.},

  abstract  = {Moving about in nature often involves walking or running on a soft yielding substratum such as sand, which has a profound effect on the mechanics and energetics of locomotion. Force platform and cinematographic analyses were used to determine the mechanical work performed by human subjects during walking and running on sand and on a hard surface. Oxygen consumption was used to determine the energetic cost of walking and running under the same conditions. Walking on sand requires 1.6-2.5 times more mechanical work than does walking on a hard surface at the same speed. In contrast, running on sand requires only 1.15 times more mechanical work than does running on a hard surface at the same speed. Walking on sand requires 2.1-2.7 times more energy expenditure than does walking on a hard surface at the same speed; while running on sand requires 1.6 times more energy expenditure than does running on a hard surface. The increase in energy cost is due primarily to two effects: the mechanical work done on the sand, and a decrease in the efficiency of positive work done by the muscles and tendons.},

  abstract  = {Substrate variations are likely to constrain animal performance in natural environments, as running over complex terrains challenges the dynamic stability of the body differently in each step. Yet, being able to negotiate complex terrains at top speed is a strong advantage for animals that have to deal with predators and evasive prey. Little is known on how animals negotiate such terrain variability at high speed. We investigated this in fast-running Acanthodactylus boskianus lizards, by measuring their 3D kinematics using four synchronised high-speed video cameras (325 Hz) on an adaptable racetrack. This racetrack was covered with four different substrates, representing increasing levels of terrain complexity. We found that the lizards deal with this complexity gradient by gradually adopting more erect parasagittal leg postures. Legs in a more-erect position are more compliant and are therefore highly adjustable on complex terrains. Additionally, the lizards stabilise their head, which facilitates vestibular and visual perception. Together, compliant legs and head stabilisation enable the lizards to minimise movements of the body centre of mass, even when running on highly irregular terrains. This suggests that the head and the centre of mass are the priority targets for running on uneven terrains. As a result, running performance (mean forward speed) decreases only slightly, and only on the most challenging substrate under investigation.},

  abstract  = {We used comparative data to test functional hypotheses for 17 antipredator behaviour patterns in artiodactyls. We examined the literature for hypotheses about auditory and visual signals, defensive behaviour and group-related antipredator behaviour in this taxon and derived a series of predictions for each hypothesis. Next, we documented occurrences of these behaviour patterns and morphological, ecological and behavioural variables for 200 species and coded them in binary format. We then pitted presence of an antipredator behaviour against presence of an independent variable for cervids, bovids and all artiodactyls together using nonparametric tests. Finally, we reanalysed the data using Maddison's (1990, Evolution, 44, 539-557) concentrated-changes tests and a consensus molecular and taxonomic phylogeny. We found evidence that snorting is both a warning signal to conspecifics and a pursuit-deterrent signal, lack of evidence that whistling alerts conspecifics and indications that foot stamping is a visual signal to warn group members. Evidence suggested that tail flagging was a signal to both conspecifics and predators, that bounding, leaping and stotting were used both as a signal and to clear obstacles and that prancing functioned similarly to foot stamping. Analyses of tail flicking, zigzagging and tacking were equivocal. We confirmed that inspection occurs in large groups, freezing enhances crypticity, and species seeking refuge in cliffs tend to be small. Entering water and attacks on predators had few correlates. Finally, group living, a putative antipredator adaptation, was associated with large body size and species living in open habitats, confirming Jarman's (1974, Behaviour, 48, 215-267) classic hypothesis. Bunching and group attack apparently deter predators. Despite limitations, comparative and systematic analyses can bolster adaptive hypotheses and raise new functional explanations for antipredator behaviour patterns in general.},

  abstract  = {Weaponry is ubiquitous in male ungulates and is driven by intrasexual selection, but the mystery surrounding its sporadic presence in females remains unsolved. Female horns are often smaller and shaped differently to male horns, suggesting a different function; indeed, hypotheses explaining the presence of female horns include competition for food, male mollification and defence against predators. Here we use comparative phylogenetic analyses to show that females are significantly more likely to bear horns in bovids that are conspicuous due to large body size and living in open habitats than inconspicuous species living in closed habitats or that are small. An inability to rely on crypsis or take refuge in deep vegetation has apparently driven the evolution of horns for defence against predators in female bovids, a finding supported by many field observations. Typically, exceptions are small species where females are territorial (e.g. duikers) and use horns in intrasexual contests. Furthermore, we suggest that conspicuousness and territoriality hypotheses may explain other instances of female cranial weaponry (i.e. antlers and ossicones) in other horned ruminants. Our phylogenetic reconstruction indicates that the primary function of horns in females is linked to antipredator defence in most clades, but occasionally to intrasexual competition in others.},

This method has been treated by various writers, and solutions are available for telegraph lines with simple terminal conditions. It is well known that the extension of the same methods to more complicated terminal conditions, which represent the usual terminal apparatus, leads to great difficulties. The present paper attacks the same problem from the alternative standpoint of the steady-state characteristics of the system. This method has the advantage over the method of transients that the complication of the circuit which results from the use of terminal apparatus does not complicate the calculations materially. This method of treatment necessitates expressing the criteria of distortionless transmission in terms of the steady-state characteristics. Accordingly, a considerable portion of the paper describes and illustrates a method for making this translation. A discussion is given of the minimum frequency range required for transmission at a given speed of signaling. In the case of carrier telegraphy, this discussion includes a comparison of single-sideband and double-sideband transmission. A number of incidental topics is also discussed.},

  abstract  = {Terrestrial locomotion on legs is energetically expensive. Compared with cycling, or with locomotion in swimming or flying animals, walking and running are highly uneconomical. Legged gaits that minimise mechanical work have previously been identified and broadly match walking and running at appropriate speeds. Furthermore, the ‘cost of muscle force’ approaches are effective in relating locomotion kinetics to metabolic cost. However, few accounts have been made for why animals deviate from either work-minimising or muscle-force-minimising strategies. Also, there is no current mechanistic account for the scaling of locomotion kinetics with animal size and speed. Here, we report measurements of ground reaction forces in walking children and adult humans, and their stance durations during running. We find that many aspects of gait kinetics and kinematics scale with speed and size in a manner that is consistent with minimising muscle activation required for the more demanding between mechanical work and power: spreading the duration of muscle action reduces activation requirements for power, at the cost of greater work demands. Mechanical work is relatively more demanding for larger bipeds - adult humans - accounting for their symmetrical M-shaped vertical force traces in walking, and relatively brief stance durations in running compared with smaller bipeds - children. The gaits of small children, and the greater deviation of their mechanics from work-minimising strategies, may be understood as appropriate for their scale, not merely as immature, incompletely developed and energetically sub-optimal versions of adult gaits.},

The patterns of GRFs during walking indicate that giraffes, similar to other mammalian quadrupeds, maintain a forelimb-biased weight distribution. The angular excursion of the neck has functional links with locomotor dynamics in giraffes, and was exaggerated at faster speeds. The horizontal accelerations of the neck and trunk were out of phase compared with the vertical accelerations, which were intermediate between in and out of phase.

  abstract  = {In polytocous species, such as pigs, the growth of an individual fetus is affected by competition from its littermates and the sow. This intrauterine competition greatly influences postnatal traits such as birth weight and vitality (physical strength). A lowered vitality is most often observed among low birth weight piglets. Since it has been argued that locomotion might be key to unraveling vitality-related differences, we compared gait development in piglets with a low birth weight and low vitality (L piglets) with piglets with a normal birth weight and normal vitality (N piglets) by means of spatio-temporal gait analysis during locomotion at self-selected speed. Video recordings of L and N piglets walking along a corridor at ten time points (between birth and 96 h after birth) were made and the footfalls were digitized. Hence, self-selected speed, spatio-temporal characteristics and gait symmetry were analyzed to compare motor performance, neuromotor maturation (motor task, interlimb and intralimb coordination) and gait variability for L and N piglets. The analysis included both absolute and normalized data (according to the dynamic similarity concept), to distinguish neuromotor maturation from effects caused by growth. Results indicate that intrauterine crowding affects locomotion, mainly by impairing growth in utero, with a lowered motor performance during the first 96 h of age as a consequence. A difference in neuromotor skills was also visible, though only for swing and stance duration, implying a difference in neuromotor development in utero. However, further maturation during the first days after birth does not seem to be affected by intrauterine crowding. We can therefore conclude that L piglets might be considered a smaller and fictitious younger version of N piglets.},

  abstract  = {In advanced members of the Equidae, the shoulder joint evolved a unique morphology about 5 Ma ago. Anatomically this diarthrosis is notable for its lack or weak development of ligaments. In fact, the normal role of ligamentous structures in bracing the joint has been taken over by muscles. One of these, the biceps brachii, exhibits morphological specializations consistent with preventing collapse of the shoulder joint during long periods of quiet standing characteristic of extant horses, thus reducing the muscular effort required to stand for prolonged periods. Osteologically, the specialization of the biceps brachii in horses is reflected by the presence of a well-developed intermediate tubercle (INT) on the proximal aspect of the humerus and by a prominent muscle origin on the supraglenoid tubercle of the scapula. Primitive horses and both fossil and extant outgroups of diverse sizes (e.g., tapirs and titanotheres) lack the intermediate tubercle and have an intertubercular sulcus that spirals medially (passing proximal to distal) with respect to the humeral head. In the derived equid state the intermediate tubercle is well-developed, bordered by distinct greater and lesser tubercles, and it is aligned parallel to the long axis of the humerus. The derived state of this character complex is incipient in Dinohippus (ca. 5 Ma) and is first well-developed in Pliocene (ca. 3.5 Ma) extinct species of Equus; it is thus a synapomorphy to unite this monophyletic clade. The function of this musculoskeletal complex is discussed in terms of body size trends and the distribution of various character states in other clades.},

Findings Our results suggest that the most valid, robust and intuitive results are obtained from the following steps: 1) centering the amplitude of the original signals around zero, 2) creating analytic signals from the original signals using the Hilbert transform, 3) calculating the phase angle using the analytic signal and 4) calculating the continuous relative phase. Interpretations The resulting continuous relative phase values are free of frequency artifacts, a problem associated with most normalization techniques, and the interpretation remains intuitive. We propose these methods for future research using continuous relative phase in studies and analyses of human movement coordination.},

  abstract  = {ABSTRACT Forelimb morphology is an indicator for terrestrial locomotor ecology. The limb morphology of the enigmatic tapir (Perissodactyla: Tapirus) has often been compared to that of basal perissodactyls, despite the lack of quantitative studies comparing forelimb variation in modern tapirs. Here, we present a quantitative assessment of tapir upper forelimb osteology using three-dimensional geometric morphometrics to test whether the four modern tapir species are monomorphic in their forelimb skeleton. The shape of the upper forelimb bones across four species (T. indicus; T. bairdii; T. terrestris; T. pinchaque) was investigated. Bones were laser scanned to capture surface morphology and 3D landmark analysis was used to quantify shape. Discriminant function analyses were performed to reveal features which could be used for interspecific discrimination. Overall our results show that the appendicular skeleton contains notable interspecific differences. We demonstrate that upper forelimb bones can be used to discriminate between species (>91% accuracy), with the scapula proving the most diagnostic bone (100% accuracy). Features that most successfully discriminate between the four species include the placement of the cranial angle of the scapula, depth of the humeral condyle, and the caudal deflection of the olecranon. Previous studies comparing the limbs of T. indicus and T. terrestris are corroborated by our quantitative findings. Moreover, the mountain tapir T. pinchaque consistently exhibited the greatest divergence in morphology from the other three species. Despite previous studies describing tapirs as functionally mediportal in their locomotor style, we find osteological evidence suggesting a spectrum of locomotor adaptations in the tapirs. We conclude that modern tapir forelimbs are neither monomorphic nor are tapirs as conserved in their locomotor habits as previously described. J.

  abstract  = {Terrestrial legged locomotion requires repeated support forces to redirect the body's vertical velocity component from down to up. We assume that the redirection is accomplished by impulsive leg forces that cause small-angle glancing collisions of a point-mass model of the animal. We estimate the energetic costs of these collisions by assuming a metabolic cost proportional to positive muscle work involved in generating the impulses. The cost of bipedal running estimated from this collisional model becomes less than that of walking at a Froude number (v2/gℓ) of about 0.7. Two strategies to reduce locomotion costs associated with the motion redirection are: (1) having legs simulate purely elastic springs, as is observed in human running; and (2) sequencing the leg forces during the redirection phase; examples of this sequencing are the ba-da-dump pattern of a horse gallop and having push-off followed by heel-strike in human walking.},

The authors used 2-way analyses of variance to assess the data. No gender differences in the mean values or variability of basic gait parameters were detected. However, the women exhibited lower variability than did the men for 6 individual joint rotations: (a) transverse plane rotations of the ankle joint at 8, 10, and 12 km/hr, (b) transverse plane rotations of the hip and knee joints at 12 km/hr, and (c) sagittal plane rotations of the ankle joint at 12 km/hr. When collapsed across all 3D lower extremity rotations, the data showed that the women had lower variability than did the men at 12 km/hr. Reduced variability may result in more localized mechanical stress on anatomical structures and could therefore be a risk factor for injury in women at high gait speeds. The results also suggested that gender differences in variability may not be consistent across different levels of the motor system.},

Objective empirical tools to measure sow lameness on farm are required. Therefore, the purpose of this study were to evaluate the embedded force plate and the GAITFour gait analysis walkway system as objective assessment tools to discriminate between sound and lame phases in multiparous sows. Twenty-four mixed parity crossbred sows were anesthetized and injected with Amphotericin B in the distal interphalangeal joint of both claws of one hind hoof to induce transient lameness. Kinematic data was collected on D−1, D+1 and D+6 relative to induction (D0). For the embedded force plate, weight distributions on each hoof were collected. Gait analysis measures collected were stride time (defined as the time (s) between 2 successive footfalls by the same hoof), stride length (defined as the distance (cm) between 2 sequential footfalls from the same hoof), maximum pressure (defined as the greatest amount of weight (kg/cm2) placed on a single hoof) and stance time (defined as the duration of time (s) the sensors were activated by a hoof in a single stride). For the embedded microcomputer-based force plate system weight placed on the induced hoof decreased on D+1 when compared to D−1 (P<0.0001). For the GAITFour® pressure mat gait analysis walkway system, stride time increased on D+1 for all hooves, stride length decreased on D+1 compared to D−1 and maximum pressure placed on the induced hoof decreased on D+1 compared to baseline levels (P<0.05). Stance time increased for all sound hooves on D+1 compared to D−1 (P<0.05). In conclusion, the embedded force plate and GAITFour walkway system all demonstrated differences for mature sows during sound and most lame phases indicating promise as objective tools for use on farm.},

One of the most widely studied performance trade-offs is the one between sprint speed and endurance. Although biochemical, physiological and (bio)mechanical correlates of either locomotor trait conflict with each other, results at the whole-organism level are mixed. Here, we test whether burst (speed, acceleration) and sustained locomotion (stamina) trade off at both the isolated muscle and whole-organism level among 17 species of lacertid lizards. In addition, we test for a mechanical link between the organismal and muscular (power output, fatigue resistance) performance traits. We find weak evidence for a trade-off between burst and sustained locomotion at the whole-organism level; however, there is a significant trade-off between muscle power output and fatigue resistance in the isolated muscle level. Variation in whole-animal sprint speed can be convincingly explained by variation in muscular power output. The variation in locomotor stamina at the whole-organism level does not relate to the variation in muscle fatigue resistance, suggesting that whole-organism stamina depends not only on muscle contractile performance but probably also on the performance of the circulatory and respiratory systems.},

  abstract  = {Abstract Avian bipedalism is best studied in derived walking/running specialists. Here, we use kinematics and center of mass (CoM) mechanical energy patterns to investigate gait transitions of lapwings—migratory birds that forage on the ground, and therefore may need a trade-off between the functional demands of terrestrial locomotion and long distance flights. The animals ran on a treadmill while high-speed X-ray videos were recorded within the sustainable speed range. Instantaneous CoM mechanics were computed from integrating kinematics and body segment properties. Lapwings exhibit similar locomotor characteristics to specialized walking/running birds, but have less distinct gaits. At slow speeds no clear separation between vaulting (i.e., walking) and bouncing (i.e., running) energy patterns exists. Mechanical energy recovery of non-bouncing gaits correlates poorly with speed and suggests inefficient use of the inverted pendulum mechanism. Speed ranges of gaits overlap considerably, especially those of grounded running, a gait with CoM mechanics indicative of running but without an aerial phase, and aerial phase running, with no preferential gait at most speeds. Compliant limb morphology and grounded running in birds can be regarded as an evolutionary constraint, but lapwings effectively make use of advantages offered by this gait for a great fraction of their speed range. Thus, effective usage of grounded running during terrestrial locomotion is suggested generally to be a part of striding avian bipedalism—even in species not specialized in walking/running locomotion.

  abstract  = {Reconstructing the locomotion of extinct vertebrates offers insights into their palaeobiology and helps to conceptualize major transitions in vertebrate evolution1-4. However, estimating the locomotor behaviour of a fossil species remains a challenge because of the limited information preserved and the lack of a direct correspondence between form and function5,6. The evolution of advanced locomotion on land--that is, locomotion that is more erect, balanced and mechanically power-saving than is assumed of anamniote early tetrapods--has previously been linked to the terrestrialization and diversification of amniote lineages7. To our knowledge, no reconstructions of the locomotor characteristics of stem amniotes based on multiple quantitative methods have previously been attempted: previous methods have relied on anatomical features alone, ambiguous locomotor information preserved in ichnofossils or unspecific modelling of locomotor dynamics. Here we quantitatively examine plausible gaits of the stem amniote Orobates pabsti, a species that is known from a complete body fossil preserved in association with trackways8. We reconstruct likely gaits that match the footprints, and investigate whether Orobates exhibited locomotor characteristics that have previously been linked to the diversification of crown amniotes. Our integrative methodology uses constraints derived from biomechanically relevant metrics, which also apply to extant tetrapods. The framework uses in vivo assessment of locomotor mechanics in four extant species to guide an anatomically informed kinematic simulation of Orobates, as well as dynamic simulations and robotics to filter the parameter space for plausible gaits. The approach was validated using two extant species that have different morphologies, gaits and footprints. Our metrics indicate that Orobates exhibited more advanced locomotion than has previously been assumed for earlier tetrapods7,9, which suggests that advanced terrestrial locomotion preceded the diversification of crown amniotes. We provide an accompanying website for the exploration of the filters that constrain our simulations, which will allow revision of our approach using new data, assumptions or methods.},

  abstract  = {In conventional geometric morphometric analyses of limb long bones, differences in the evolutionary capacity of articular surfaces and non-articular structures often remain unrecognised. It can be shown that areas of high spatial variance dominate shape data, which is problematic for the functional interpretation of limb long bone shape. We herein introduce Procrustes superimposition by static reference (PSSR), a novel analysis strategy that aims to facilitate morpho-functional inference. This procedure exploits the spatial constraint of some reference structures (in our case, articular surfaces) for the superimposition of other subareas (e.g. muscle attachment sites) in relation to that static reference. PSSR allows for the transformation of raw scan data, enabling researchers to extract geometric models of two- and three-dimensional substructures that cannot effectively be integrated with landmarks. As we demonstrate by a simple model analysis for one muscle attachment site, this procedure can yield measures of direct functional relevance. Multivariate analysis of an extensive set of subareas indicates how this type of data relates to conventional shape coordinates. The shape evolution of xenarthran humeri, which has previously been subject to a detailed study (Milne et al., J Zool 278(1):48-56, 2009), serves as a test case. The concept of a variance-based separation of landmark subsets expands mathematical methods by incorporating knowledge about evolutionary constraints. PSSR could therefore find application far beyond the intuitive case study of long bone shape.},

  abstract  = {The basic mechanics of human locomotion are associated with vaulting over stiff legs in walking and rebounding on compliant legs in running. However, while rebounding legs well explain the stance dynamics of running, stiff legs cannot reproduce that of walking. With a simple bipedal spring–mass model, we show that not stiff but compliant legs are essential to obtain the basic walking mechanics; incorporating the double support as an essential part of the walking motion, the model reproduces the characteristic stance dynamics that result in the observed small vertical oscillation of the body and the observed out-of-phase changes in forward kinetic and gravitational potential energies. Exploring the parameter space of this model, we further show that it not only combines the basic dynamics of walking and running in one mechanical system, but also reveals these gaits to be just two out of the many solutions to legged locomotion offered by compliant leg behaviour and accessed by energy or speed.},
