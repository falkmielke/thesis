Modern-day computational and scientific tools have led to a deep understanding of life and its processes.
We can witness the birth of another living being, and measure and compare parameters to quantify the miracle.
We can feel emotionally stirred by that encounter, empathize with the mother or the offspring, feel delight and astonishment, and analyze the physiological improbability of the event.
We can be amazed by how little (or how much) time it takes for a little one to stand and walk, to /live/ independently, by measuring it with a digital stop watch.
We can feel sad for individuals initiated with disadvantageous traits, and we can screen which environmental effects have influenced development.

Thanks to sophisticated analytical tools, we can understand to an ever-growing extent what exactly is going on during the propagation of life.
Does analyzing and understanding the wonder make it less beautiful?
Does knowing the workings of a "wonder" make it less wonderful?

Reproduction is a process under particularly strong evolutionary control, and therefore it is complex.
The variable processes around birth are strongly correlated to a species' survival.
In cases of strong correlation, we speak of "selection", a concept to which we ascribe some of the most puzzling and fascinating phenomena in nature.
Any deviations in reproductive or developmental processes can have direct, positive or negative consequences for the survival of the offspring.
For example, if a parental organism manages to provide its offspring with extra resources, potentially at its own disadvantage, then the lineage will have an advantage @@latex:\citep[but see][]{Trivers1974}@@.
On the other hand, if development of the offspring deviates from the norm, it may easily be fatal.
Accordingly, the number and size of offspring has to strike a certain balance citep:Smith1974,Andersen2011.
Through the workings of evolution, birth and perinatal development have evolved to be the astonishingly complex processes we observe.


Locomotion is a highly complex phenomenon by itself, for the same reasons: in the "struggle for existence", a wrong step might be fatal.
We have some ... # TODO
To summarize, perinatal development is complex, analyzing locomotion is non-trivial, and thus it is no surprise that the quick perinatal locomotor maturation of precocial animals turns out to be a methodologically challenging topic.
\bigskip

This thesis project set out to investigate in detail the putative deficits of piglets with lower-than-normal birth weight in locomotor development.
While the heart of this thesis are newborn piglets learning to walk, its backbone is computational methodology, applied in a novel context.
Just as with the novel AI capabilities which currently invade our everyday life, it is important to stay sceptical of the purpose and usefulness of the exapted algorithms.
Computational techniques can be abstract, and sometimes their purpose only becomes clear on second application.
This can be challenging to present to a broad public.
It might help if, on the way, we make sure not to loose sight of the acutal phenomenon under study.
I, the author, personally think that the birth and maturation of a piglet (or any creature) are beautiful and fascinating processes, and I appreciate the opportunity to study them in detail.
Nevertheless, herein, I will not ponder further upon the emotional or artistic aspects of the beauty of nature and life.
The core purpose of this thesis is to assemble, extend, and scientifically evaluate some relevant facets of current research methods around locomotor development.

** Piglets
\chng{Any creature's birth can be fascinating and its study insightful.}
Why do we study piglets?

The first is the trivial reason: *because we can*.
Our institute at the University of Antwerp has phenomenal equipment.
We have incubator-like rearing containers in the "Ark" (a teaching stable in our Veterinary Science department), which can be a cozy warm home to newborn piglets.
We have the \(3D^2YMOX\) ([[https://www.uantwerpen.be/en/research-groups/3d2ymox][3-Dimensional DYnamic MOrphology using X-rays]]) facility to measure moving animals from hoof to head in light and x-ray vision.
The [[https://www.uantwerpen.be/flexct][FleXCT scanning facility]] is just around the block, and the friendly, but expensive technicians there will scan anything you bring them.
We have great interdisciplinary collaboration of teams: veterinarians of CoPeD (Comparative Perinatal Development), physicists from the imec-Visionlab and Biomedical Physics (Bimef), and not least bioligists at FunMorph (Functional Morphology).
The settings could not have been better, and I cannot overstate my praise of all the fantastic people who helped with the projects herein, and all those who previously managed to acquire funding for what enabled my work.
# TODO (see acknowledgements, Ch. \ref{acknowledgements})
Thank you!

Such equipment and personnel could have been used to study other species of animals.
However, there are size limitations.
The maximum focal volume of the \(3D^2YMOX\) is about the size of a one week old piglet.
The resolution might be a constraint on too small animals, such as rodents.
Piglets fit; and as domestic farm animals they are relatively abundant in Belgium.

So we can. And we did.


There is another trivial reason: *curiosity*.
We are scientists, and like to study.
Piglets are interesting, as I hope this thesis will leave no doubt:
they are precocial, but less than most ungulates; they are social, but neonate competition is fierce; they are curious and active; and they share some common features with our own species.
Furthermore, the general workings of locomotion are exciting to us.
Just observing the outcome of the fine interplay of muscles, tendons, joints, bones - to us scientists, observing this commonplace behavior in high resolution and slow motion is the equivalent of an audiophile listening to a Dvořák symphony.
Or to a physicist seeing a rainbow citep:Lewin2012.
Have you actually /seen/ one?


Yet, back to our cute, pink subject animals.
We could have studied any animal; if fact, some of us might have certainly preferred flamingos or boxfish.
This is why, at this point and below, I will have to apply a common human stategy: /ex post/ rationalization.
Walking piglets are graceful in their simplicity.
And "graceful", just like in (human) sports or in playing musical instruments, often describes something which is complex and complicated but performed to look simple.
Well, sports and music requires training, and the most adept athletes or musicians seem to us as if they have never done anything else in their lives.
But in contrast to hominid trained specialists, the piglets we study indeed have never done anything else in their lives!
They are born, and they walk more or less gracefully within eight hours, as my colleague Charlotte concluded from her exemplary PhD work citep:VandenHole2019thesis.
How much trouble it would save us, and how much different trouble it would cause, if our own toddlers could pull that trick!


#+CAPTION: "Leihmutter Jolante", by Ernst Kahl (date unknown). \chng{Proof that real art can supersede current AI outcomes.}
#+ATTR_LATEX: :placement [p] :width 8cm
#+LABEL: fig:jolante
[[./figures/jolante.jpg]]


Which brings us to the third reason: *piglets are, to a certain degree, analogous to humans*.
In other words, we have the working hypothesis that piglets are a good model species for some aspects of human ontogeny (Fig. \ref{fig:jolante}).
Emphasis on "/to a certain degree/" - are they, really?
\chng{I will get back to this at the end of the thesis (Ch. \ref{cpt:generaldiscussion})}
Domestic pigs are maybe the only species in the world that is more degenerate than our own (or maybe not).
They are sedentary, comparatively hairless, highly social, omnivorous (which means they can live of the crap humans feed them), training them to work takes considerable efforts.
They have probably gone through a couple of founder situations in their evolution, yet are far more proliferous than is good for themselves and the planet.
That is already quite a lot to have in common.
And indeed, many researchers rightfully argue that we can draw conclusions about humans from studying piglets - for some aspects of our humble, shared existence.
For example, highly relevant research about infant gut function was achieved by the group of Prof. Per Sangild citep:Muk2023,Che2010,Cilieborg2011,Sangild2006.
\chng{One} aspect of newborn piglets is that some individuals are \chng{putatively} born with a deficit.
Those have received different classification labels: small for gestational age, growth retarded, low vitality; for the majority of this thesis, I will stick to the phenomenological classification of "low birth weight", or LBW, yet the fine nuances in the different classifications deserve further discussion citep:Wootton1983,VanGinneken2022.
Kids can be troubling.
Prof. Sangild argued in his Francqui honorary lecture here at the University of Antwerp (April 26, 2022) that having kids during a PhD is detrimental for progress of the project; which teases me to contribute contradicting evidence (this thesis).

But the question remains: *can piglet serve as a model species for the study of human /locomotion/?*
An obvious "show stopper" might be that, as mentioned above, piglets are precocial, whereas humans are about as altricial as can be.
On the other hand, suids are the more altricial of the ungulates: feral /Sus scrofa/ females build nests and keep their young in shelter for a couple of weeks citep:Wischner2009.
Unfortunately, domestication involved restraining sows, and the way we keep them might have favored more mobile young who have reduced mortality from crushing citep:Grandinson2002.
The picture is complex, and certainly the analogy of piglets and humans should not be taken for granted citep:VandenHole2017.


A second "show stopper" for this thesis would be if it turns out that the effect we would like to quantify (a difference between piglets of low- and normal birth weight, see Fig. \ref{fig:birth_weight}) is negligible in magnitude.
In other words: if the locomotion of newborn piglets of low and normal birth weight actually does not differ in a measurable way.
First off, it is obvious that low and normal birth weights do differ: per definition, in terms of weight.
But different weight might go in hand with different physical constraints, and one has to account for the trivial consequences of a different physical appearance citep:Aerts2023.
The fact that there are hyperprolific sows, increased litter sizes, and an increased rate of intra-uterine growth restriction and low birth weight citep:Alvarenga2013,Quiniou2002 is in itself an argument for using domestic pigs as a model for human early development (see above), it gives us useful categories for comparison.
But how to approach the potential lack of an effect?
To set the frontier right from the start, I will insist to apply good scientific methods citep:Chamberlin1890,Platt1964,Popper2002.
If we /searched for/ differences in piglet locomotion, just search hard enough, we would surely find them.
@@latex:\begin{change}@@
The null hypothesis in statistical testing is that there are no differences between the study groups, which is why researchers tend to actively search for and find differences.
However, with so many variables influencing locomotion (multiple testing), it is inevitable that some variables will differ, yet it cannot be presumed that these differences generalize to the population from which we sampled.
@@latex:\end{change}@@
Instead, our attempts must be to *falsify the hypothesis that there are birth-weight dependent differences in piglet locomotion*.
If we fail, we learned something.

#+CAPTION: Piglets of low and normal birth weight (left/right, respectively) for size comparison. The animals are female siblings.

#+LABEL: fig:birth_weight
[[./figures/bw_comparison.jpg]]



Common methods of studying locomotion fall short in their falsification capacity.
First, some methods \chng{miss or} loose information in processing.
For example, imagine we measured two maximally dissimilar animals, a stork and an elephant.
@@latex:\begin{change}@@
The stork will use high clearance, high flexion, being adapted to cluttered terrain and swampy underground, whereas the elephant is large, "graviportal", and usually walks with minimal joint flexion along the limb.
@@latex:\end{change}@@
We could observe these animals while \chng{they are} co-incidentally running at dynamically similar speed;
@@latex:\chng{assume that we}@@ measure exactly the same (normalized) speed.
If we do not see differences in that measure, we cannot exclude that the subjects (likely) differ in the way they move their limbs (coordination).
Second, methods might have trouble handling variation.
One subject animal was observed to be slower in one trial, but does that mean it /cannot/ /ever/ go faster as well?
So, on the one hand, failing to incorporate (or even summarize) repeated measurements might be neglecting variation.
What does it mean if there is a significant difference \chng{which is of the order of magnitude approximately equal to the} standard error of the mean of the measurement?
On the other hand, methods can amplify variation, by not including all parameters: imagine the "unexplained" variation within a set of recordings of piglet aged 0-10 days, but not documenting the age (which brings us to the next point).
Third, the matter is complex: just for kinematics, there are subject characteristics (age, sex, ...), spatiotemporal gait variables (speed, duty factor, clearance, ...), dynamic posture and effective range of motion, and finally coordination.
Stay tuned for more on this.
Fourth, if we measure, we must keep track of measurement uncertainty.
If we do not know how accurate a figure was, it is meaningless.
We better have a potent modeling framework to incorporate all that data: if we do not incorporate all measures or fail to explain their variability, differences might be due to sampling biases and "hidden" variables.
The falsification approach is a unifying aspect of all the chapters herein.


*To summarize*, there \chng{are some genuine reasons for studying suid ontogeny, and there are some methodological challenges which we need to adress.}
Yet whether or not domestic piglets are a good model species, specifically for human locomotor development, is up for debate, \chng{and I will return to it in the general discussion (Ch. \ref{cpt:generaldiscussion})}.


** Limitations of Piglet Locomotor Research
@@latex:\begin{change}@@
Part of the natural fate of this (and any) thesis is that others have done research on the topic before.
Existing research specifically on piglet neonate locomotion is diverse.
It covers activity and welfare citep:Kashiha2014,Beattie2000, muscle workings and general motor function citep:Alvarenga2013,Andersen2016,
behavioral and neurological (dys-)function citep:Sullivan2013,Roelofs2019, and gait citep:Meijer2014,VandenHole2017,VandenHole2019thesis,VanWachenfelt2008.
# low birthweight in particular Cooper1975


We already know a lot about many aspects of piglet locomotion, yet there are _two major limitations_.
Firstly, *transferability is limited* @@latex:\citep[\textit{cf.}][]{Gatesy2011}@@: it is not immediately possible to mirror findings in morphologically disparate species (such as humans).
Pigs are precocial quadrupeds, and it might seem far-fetched to apply analogous hypotheses to bipedal humans, let alone to our helpless, immobile infants.
Secondly, most methods only superficially quantify locomotion: they work on general activity patterns or spatiotemporal gait variables, or remain qualitative in the comparison of kinematic profiles.
Few studies dig deep into *intra-limb coordination*, i.e. the temporal succession of limb segment movements.


The compensation strategies I attempt in this thesis are methodological development, and the move to a model species (baboons, facultative bipeds) which can be considered "intermediate".
@@latex:\end{change}@@


* Limited Transferability: Methodological Prior Knowledge
** Baboons
So there is a limitation to piglets.
Or, rather, I consider it a bonus.
They have two extra limbs on the ground, thus four limbs in total.
This gives us about twice the number of joints to analyze when studying grounded locomotion.
Not trivial to handle, but feasible, as I show below.


It came as a great coincidence that, during SEB conference 2021, I watched my colleage François Druelle presenting a data set acquired from bipedally walking baboons (/Papio anubis/).
The rationale to study these animals can be directly transferred to this thesis: they are facultatively bipedal, i.e. they occasionally walk on their hind limbs, just like humans often do citep:Aerts2023b.
Prof. Druelle and colleagues thus analyzed a developmental series of baboons: infant, adolescent, and adult individuals citep:Druelle2021.
Their intention is to find out if and how the use of a bipedal gait changes with age.


That sounded like a familiar task, and with the euphoria of just having implemented a different, potentially useful method (FCAS, see Ch. \ref{cpt:fcas}), I reached out to François and he kindly provided the data.
Not only the videos, but also the tracking (i.e. kinematics "to go").
I much appreciate the time and effort François and his colleagues and students put into generating the data, and I am thankful for the exchange.
And I regret that this has not been put into another publication, mostly for the lack of time.


Nevertheless, work on the baboon data set has a prominent place in this thesis.
The fact that there are fewer joints (bipedal), the fact that the data set has been well studied before, and the fact that this is also a developmental series (though different: age groups are discrete), predestined this data set to be my "playground".
I used it to refine my procedures and code.
And I ended up writing two "tutorial"-chapters, one each for Fourier Methods (part \ref{pt:1}) and Probabilistic Modeling (part \ref{pt:2}).


Yet in fact, you could argue the other way round.
Piglets are a putative model species, but require some transfer work to draw reliable conclusions about humans and human development.
/Papio/, on the other hand, are bipedal primates, and their bipedalism develops gradually over time -- just like in our own species.
On the downside, baboons are less readily available, also for dynamic measurements (e.g. XROMM, part \ref{pt:3}).
Hence it is good to keep both model species in the loop.

@@latex:\begin{change}@@
Having a biped on board makes trunsferability more likely, but is no guarantee: it might be hard to transfer findings to human infants, since there is still morphological and behavioral discrepancy.
To work towards solving this issue, it might be useful to take one step back, explore what locomotion is /technically/, and see which analytical methods are available.
@@latex:\end{change}@@


** \chng{What is Locomotion?}
Fix a single solid metal rod to a support with a frictionless cylindrical joint, deflect it by a small angle, and let gravity do its predictable magic.
This is a simple oscillator, a "physical pendulum", which physics professors enjoy assigning to their students as calculation exercise citep:2022Pendulums.
Now add a second such element, another cylindrical joint and metal rod.
Something astonishing happens: we get chaos citep:2021Chaos.
Even more fun to calculate.
Due to miniscule variations in the initial conditions of this system, it cannot be solved deterministically any more.


Animal limbs resemble the physical pendulum: they have more restrictive joints, yet usually even more segments.
We should expect chaos on this system.
But chaos is not what we observe, quite the contrary.
Locomotor movements are highly targeted, i.e. pseudo-deterministic, often repetetive.
Variations (though ubiquitous) are minimized by training.
@@latex:\begin{change}@@
This observation is due to *coordination*: coordination is henceforth understood as the non-random temopral pattern of movement which manifests in a specific succession of movements of different joints within a limb (intra-limb coordination) or between limbs (inter-limb coordination).
@@latex:\end{change}@@
Coordination is achieved by (neuro-)motor control.
@@latex:\begin{change}@@
Control in the scope of this thesis is achieved by the central or peripheral nervous structure which establishes coordination.
@@latex:\end{change}@@
The study of neuromechanics attempts to relate the central and peripheral control mechanisms to the observed motor outcome produced by the musculoskeletal system, i.e. coordination citep:Nishikawa2007,Full1999.
Of course, the control "facilities" of each individual are bespoke for the precise anatomy of that individual: each brain is tuned to the layout of segments and motors of each individual.
We do not know the exact "wiring" of each animal, though remarkably we observe "functioning" individuals time and time again, which are the less interesting cases in which the nervous system does a great job in steering its muscles.

Because of this intimate link, the motor system can be considered a looking glass into the workings of the neural system of animals.
This can be understood in an evolutionary sense: a change in the behavior, e.g. a transition to bipedality, will reflect in the control system citep:Zehr2016.
It can also be understood in a medical sense: if an individual does not "walk" as expected, locomotion enables the diagnosis of disease citep:Mielke2023.
Perturbations, both in the environment citep:Daley2018 and in the two systems citep:Ting2015,DeGroote2021,Sponberg2023, and the organisms response to it, can be analyzed to understand the robustness, plasticity, and rehabilitation of motor control.


The vertebrate locomotor system is highly complex, therefore sensitive to changes, and therefore a relevant multi-purpose tool for diagnostic and comparative research.
\chng{Yet to fully understand it, we need in-depth analytical tools which capture the whole ensemble of characteristic parameters.}



** Which Analytical Tools Do We Have?
One would think that our toolbox to study terrestrial locomotion is well-developed and sophisticated citep:McHenry2023,Demuth2023.
After all, locomotion has been intriguing people for hundreds, thousands, maybe tens of thousands of years.
Whenever humans develop a new imaging technique, from cave drawings to digital cameras, they use it (first for pornography, and second) for locomotion (Figs. \ref{fig:muybridge}, \ref{fig:jumpiglet}).

#+CAPTION: "The Horse in Motion", by Eadweard Muybridge (1878). It seems like every PhD thesis on locomotion or cinematography has to start with Muybridge.

#+CAPTION: "The Piglet in Motion", by Falk Mielke (2020). Sophisticated, modern technology exists for studying animal locomotion, but the idea is the same.
#+ATTR_LATEX: :width 16cm :placement [p]
#+LABEL: fig:jumpiglet
[[./figures/piglet_in_motion.jpg]]


In consequence, the /technology/ for studying locomotion is available, and sophisticated.
Consumer grade cameras have a high temporal and spatial resolution, and can be calibrated to measure 3D space.
Compare modern day smartphone cams to, for example, contemporary x-ray techniques for studying the inside of things: both are equally recent, resolution of the latter is usually inferior, price difference is defeating, yet we do not even have color on x-ray (although it is just another form of electromagnetic radiation, see Ch. \ref{cpt:inertials}).
Visible light videography seems to be far more accessible than other imaging techniques.
We can thus expect that far better camera equipment is available than would minimally be required for our research questions.
Sounds too easy - which is probably why my supervisors decided to send me out to a pig farm in 2017 with an inferior JVC camcorder (while a synced 4-cam 300fps Norpix system, and a set of high res GoPro's, were available at the time).
Although that would not be fair to claim.
There is also always an allocation to be set on the spectrum of video quality (especially framerate) and manually processing time (see Ch. \ref{cpt:digitization}), and I might still be clicking points on videos today if my supervisors had decided differently.
And, after all, that video data might be the most relevant data of this PhD citep:Mielke2023.


Acquiring videos is just the first step: as always in science, we need numbers and statistics to get reliable results.
Where are we at the analysis side?
You might be underwhelmed.
We are in the year 2023, and (as if agnostic to the rise of computers) people still essentially rely on footfall patterns citep:Hildebrand1989, their spatiotemporal derivates (stride frequency, speed, duty factor, etc.), and visually comparing angular profiles citep:Ekhator2023,Plocek2023,Young2023,Jones2023.
Those are doubtlessly great methods to get an overview, and they remain the go-to first analysis for any kinematic data set.
Yet as I will argue in the chapters to follow, they only capture limited information and are therefore insufficient for a falsification approach, as illustrated with the stork and elephant example above.


People have certainly /tried/ to complement the conventional measurements with more in-depth computational methods.
"Planar Covariation" theory came out of one attempt to develop a technique which captures the essence of terrestrial locomotion citep:Borghese1996,Ivanenko2008.
I think it is flawed, in a sense that it biases the data for high correlation just to find out that it is highly correlated.
Throughout the chapters of this thesis, you will find subtle and polite rants about the planar covariation technique, so I will not go into detail at this point.

@@latex:\begin{change}@@
Another, potentially useful method is Statistical Parametric Mapping citep:Friston1994,Friston2008,Worsley2004,Pataky2008,Pataky2020.
It is designed to test one-dimensional (e.g. time-varying) data, such as kinematic profiles, for the statistical evaluation of group differences.
"Statistical evaluation" refers to classical hypothesis testing, which is normally complicated by the non-independence of continuous temporal measurements.
SPM implements various hypothesis tests for continuous data by a clever adaptation of random field theory citep:Brett2003,Kemeny1976.
The method first and foremost tackles the temporal interdependence of measurement points citep:Pataky2020.
It does not overcome the limitations mentioned above, transferability of kinematics and the quantification of intra-limb coordination.
And its current implementations are restricted to classical, frequentist statistics, with all its assumptions and pitfalls.
For these reasons, I have not applied SPM in my research, nevertheless appended a brief summary of that method for interested readers (Ch. \ref{cpt:spm1d}; cf. [[https://spm1d.org]]).
@@latex:\end{change}@@


** \chng{An Overlooked Transformation}
And then there is one strain of locomotor science which deviates from the Western mainstream.
It was advanced by Nikolai A. Bernstein, and I have dedicated a whole chapter to it (Ch. \ref{cpt:fourier_review}).
His group excelled in at least two ways citep:Bongaardt2000,Bernstein1935.
They used clever engineering to get continuous measures of joint positions citep:Bernstein1927b and applied angular transformations (i.e. Fourier Series) to analyze the data citep:Bernstein1927a.
These early works are remarkable, and the day I first read through it and realized their importance was maybe one of the happiest days of my PhD.
Essentially, what I did in the work summarized herein, is transferring Bernstein's ideas to a computer framework, and extending them with moderen statistical models.
I acknowledge that I am not the first one to take this route citep:Pike2002,Webb2007.
And there is a group of authors who have translated, popularized, and advanced the "Bernstein school" citep:Latash2010,Latash2008,Latash1998,Laczko2016.
However, given the usefulness of the transformation, I find that +there are+ google scholar returns astonishingly few studies to date who have applied Fourier Analysis to locomotor data.


@@latex:\begin{change}@@
Venturing along this path, implementing and improving the Fourier analysis method, has partially led this thesis away from its original study subject, neonate piglets.
In the end, my work has taken a methodological focus much stronger than anticipated.
Yet this is justified in the preliminary observation that differences in low- and normal birth weight are on the subtle side of the possible effect magnitude spectrum (possibly more visible on intra-limb coordination), and in consequence only the finest tools would be capable of detecting them.
Furthermore, as I will demonstrate in the individual chapters of this thesis, transformation to the frequency domain can help to partly overcome one of the major limitations posed above: the transferability of kinematic data.
In the frequency domain, some aspects of locomotion are easily and logically separated (namely: posture, effective range of motion, and intralimb coordination).
Apparent differences in either of these separated measures can be related to subject characteristics, such as morphology.


This opens up the path to more refined answers to long-standing comparative and evolutionary research questions.
@@latex:\end{change}@@


*To summarize,* there are a lot of computational tools at hand to study locomotion.
Some are old, some more recent.
Some capture only a fraction of the information, others try to be inclusive.
Some are frequently used, but the ones I find most relevant did not get the recognition in the field that I would think they deserve.
This thesis is also an attempt to rectify that.

* Thesis Outline

And this is where my PhD project found its place.
We study piglet locomotion, attempting to falsify a difference that is due to birth weight category.
This requires a methodological foundation on topics unfamiliar to most Biologists (Fourier Analysis, probabilistic models), which I introduce in dedicated parts.

\chng{By adopting and extending these existing techniques for the framework of biomechanical research, I demonstrate a way to overcome previous limitations of transferability and the quantitative analysis of coordination.}


The thesis will have the following structure.

_Part \ref{pt:1}: Kinematic Analysis_
+ I will introduce Fourier Methods with a practical guide and review its occurrence specifically in the field of locomotor biomechanics (Ch. \ref{cpt:fourier_review}).
+ The power of Fourier tools is then unleashed onto a large cross-species study that covers most of the ungulate clade @@latex: \citep[Ch. \ref{cpt:fcas},][]{Mielke2019}@@.

_Part \ref{pt:2}: Probabilistic Modeling_
+ Processing complex kinematic data, I will introduce the basics of probabilistic modeling (Ch. \ref{cpt:statistics}) in a "tiny textbook of statistics", \chng{which is based on an example of locomotor development in baboons}.
+ \chng{Moving on to piglets, I will turn} the conventional modeling strategy upside down and applying a predictive model to piglets @@latex:\citep[Ch. \ref{cpt:piglets},][]{Mielke2023}@@.

_Part \ref{pt:3}: Dynamics_
+ Kinematics are just half of locomotor research: the study of forces and moments is reviewed and summarized in another overview chapter (Ch. \ref{cpt:dynamics_workflow}).
+ To calculate joint moments, one needs to measure inertial properties, yet it turns out that these are not trivial to retrieve from x-ray tomographic images (Ch. \ref{cpt:inertials}).

The thesis closes with a general discussion to round up and project the presented work to potential future applications (Ch. \ref{cpt:generaldiscussion}).
Enjoy reading!
