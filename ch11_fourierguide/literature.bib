    abstract = {Summary This study was undertaken to evaluate the flexion-extension movements of the back in a group of sound trotting horses. Using a 3-D kinematic analysis system, 13 clinically sound horses fitted with 5 skin markers placed on the dorsal midline of their trunk were recorded while trotting on a track in the conditions of the routine lameness examination. These markers were used to calculate 3 back angles (thoracic, thoracolumbar and lumbosacral angle). These back angles were then filtered using Fourier series. To evaluate the repeatability of flexion-extension movements, the intra- and inter-individual variabilities were studied. The angle-time diagrams showed that the equine back extended during the first part of each diagonal stance phase and flexed during the second part of each diagonal stance phase. The ranges of motion were less than 4° for the 3 back angles. The intra- and inter-individual variability values of maximal extension and maximal flexion time points were similar and extremely low. This demonstrates the high repeatability of the temporal pattern of flexion-extension movements of the back. Intra-and inter-individual variabilities of the range of motion showed that the back mobility varies more in-between horses than between trials of the same horse. Compared with electromyographic activities of back muscles reported in the literature, flexion-extension movements described in this study tend to show that, at a slow trot, trunk muscles act mainly to limit flexion-extension movements of the back rather than to induce movements.},

In this article, the authors pose the following question: Does the disagreement arise from the structure of his work itself or from incomplete exploitation of his thinking? By using, inter alia, Bernstein's 24 English and German articles, the authors present an analysis of the development of Bernstein's theory of movement behavior, against the backdrop of the scientific progress in the Soviet Union in Bernstein's time and the clashes between Soviet politics and science. Bernstein addressed in his early articles the measurement and biomechanical analysis of movements. His experimental data soon indicated the need for a new understanding of the organization of movements, which he formulated in terms of coordination. Because of political problems, his work was interrupted; but after being “rehabilitated” and again allowed to work. Bernstein aimed to explain how animals find and optimize the solutions to motor problems. The structure of the theory that ensued was comprehensive exactly by virtue of his repeatedly shifting focus between the different aspects of the organization of movement: More important than the answers he gave were the questions he asked. Moreover, the way he approached those questions may help scientists solve pressing problems in present-day movement science. },

It has shown promise in many medical imaging applications but has high computational requirements. This paper presents a general transform that describes Fourier-family transforms, including the Fourier, short-time Fourier, and S- transforms. A discrete, nonredundant formulation of this transform, as well as algorithms for calculating the forward and inverse transforms are also developed. These utilize efficient sampling of the time-frequency plane and have the same computational complexity as the fast Fourier transform. When configured appropriately, this new algorithm samples the continuous S-transform spectrum efficiently and nonredundantly, allowing signals to be transformed in milliseconds rather than days, as compared to the original S-transform algorithm.

Recent innovations in tracking technology have allowed researchers to collect large and highly accurate datasets on animal spatiotemporal position while vastly decreasing the time and cost of collecting such data. One technique that is of particular relevance to the study of behavioral ecology involves tracking visual tags that can be uniquely identified in separate images or movie frames. These tags can be located within images that are visually complex, making them particularly well suited for longitudinal studies of animal behavior and movement in naturalistic environments. While several software packages have been developed that use computer vision to identify visual tags, these software packages are either (a) not optimized for identification of single tags, which is generally of the most interest for biologists, or (b) suffer from licensing issues, and therefore their use in the study of animal behavior has been limited. Here, we present BEEtag, an open-source, image-based tracking system in Matlab that allows for unique identification of individual animals or anatomical markers. The primary advantages of this system are that it (a) independently identifies animals or marked points in each frame of a video, limiting error propagation, (b) performs well in images with complex backgrounds, and (c) is low-cost. To validate the use of this tracking system in animal behavior, we mark and track individual bumblebees (Bombus impatiens) and recover individual patterns of space use and activity within the nest. Finally, we discuss the advantages and limitations of this software package and its application to the study of animal movement, behavior, and ecology.}},

We hypothesized that complexity and variability of limb segment motion during gait would increase in both limbs due to unilateral injury. Using simulated injury to generate asymmetric gait, we developed new methods to quantify changes in the complexity and variability of limb segment angular phase portraits. ; Methods: To simulate reduced range of motion associated with knee injury, the right knee was constrained to full extension by an external brace. Thigh, shank and foot segment angular phase portraits were generated from 20 healthy male subjects walking for 3-minute trials with and without the brace. Using Fourier-based methods, complexity was quantified by the number of harmonic frequencies suitable for fitting the phase-portrait shape — with a larger number of harmonics indicating greater complexity. Variability was characterized by the drift and confidence area generated by the inter-cycle excursion of the phase-portrait centroid. ; Findings: Significant differences were found in complexity and variability measures due to bracing. Phase-portrait shape complexity and variability increased in the right (braced) limb, compared to the unbraced condition; while only variability increased for the left (contralateral) limb during bracing. ; Interpretation: These new methods proved successful at quantifying changes in the complexity and variability that have been visually observed in phase portraits during asymmetric gait. This work provides a method that can be incorporated into clinical assessments to provide quantifiable measures of more precise differences in gait dynamics.},

In humans, children improve their walking skills through developmental processes and learning experience. In nonhuman primates, infants do not routinely experience bipedalism and their musculoskeletal system gradually specializes for other locomotor modes. The aim of this study is to explore the development of occasional bipedal walking in olive baboon and to test whether the postural adjustments change with age. Materials and Methods We collected kinematics and spatiotemporal parameters of bipedal gait in an ontogenetic sample of 24 baboons. Data were collected at the primatology station of the CNRS (France) and a total of 47 bipedal strides were extracted for the present analysis. Results Adults and adolescents walk bipedally in the same way, and the average kinematic pattern is similar across the age-classes. Infants walk bipedally with longer duty factor, they present larger movement amplitude of the thigh and the amplitude of the knee joint decreases with speed. In contrast, older baboons increase the amplitude of the knee and ankle joints with speed. Discussion In a non-adapted biped, the postural adjustments of bipedal walking vary with age. In infant baboons, the balance requirements are likely to be higher and these are solved by adopting a “blocking strategy”. In older baboons, the postural adjustments are focused on the lower limb and the movements increase with speed. These results may echo, in some respects, the developmental sequence of the intersegmental coordination described in the ontogeny of human locomotion.}

One of the decisive transitions has been from the sprawled, bi-segmented to the parasagittal, tri-segmented limb. Here, we review aspects of the tri-segmented limb in locomotion which have been elucidated in our research groups in the last 10 years. First, we report the kinematics of the tri-segmented therian limb from mouse to elephant in order to explore general principles of the therian limb configuration and locomotion. Torques will be reported from a previous paper (Witte et al., 2002. J Exp Biol 205:1339–1353) for a better understanding of the anti-gravity work of all limb joints. The stability of a limb in z-configuration will be explained and its advantage with respect to other potential solutions from modeling will be discussed. Finally, we describe how the emerging concept of self-stability can be explained for a tri-segmented leg template and how it affects the design of the musculoskeletal system and the operation of legs during locomotion. While locomotion has been considered as mainly a control problem in various disciplines, we stress the necessity to reduce control as much as possible. Central control can be cheap if the limbs are “intelligent” by means of their design. Gravity-induced movements and self-stability seem to be energy-saving mechanisms.},

    abstract = {Human erect locomotion is unique among living primates. Evolution selected specific biomechanical features that make human locomotion mechanically efficient. These features are matched by the motor patterns generated in the CNS. What happens when humans walk with bent postures? Are normal motor patterns of erect locomotion maintained or completely reorganized? Five healthy volunteers walked straight and forward at different speeds in three different postures (regular, knee-flexed, and knee- and trunk-flexed) while their motion, ground reaction forces, and electromyographic (EMG) activity were recorded. The three postures imply large differences in the position of the center of body mass relative to the body segments. The elevation angles of the trunk, pelvis, and lower limb segments relative to the vertical in the sagittal plane, the ground reaction forces and the rectified EMGs were analyzed over the gait cycle. The waveforms of the elevation angles along the gait cycle remained essentially unchanged irrespective of the adopted postures. The first two harmonics of these kinematic waveforms explain >95\% of their variance. The phase shift but not the amplitude ratio between the first harmonic of the elevation angle waveforms of adjacent pairs was affected systematically by changes in posture. Thigh, shank, and foot angles covaried close to a plane in all conditions, but the plane orientation was systematically different in bent versus erect locomotion. This was explained by the changes in the temporal coupling among the three segments. For walking speeds >1 m s−1, the plane orientation of bent locomotion indicates a much lower mechanical efficiency relative to erect locomotion. Ground reaction forces differed prominently in bent versus erect posture displaying characteristics intermediate between those typical of walking and those of running. Mean EMG activity was greater in bent postures for all recorded muscles independent of the functional role. The waveforms of the muscle activities and muscle synergies also were affected by the adopted posture. We conclude that maintaining bent postures does not interfere either with the generation of segmental kinematic waveforms or with the planar constraint of intersegmental covariation. These characteristics are maintained at the expense of adjustments in kinetic parameters, muscle synergies and the temporal coupling among the oscillating body segments. We argue that an integrated control of gait and posture is made possible because these two motor functions share some common principles of spatial organization.},

The key part of the method is the ‘empirical mode decomposition’ method with which any complicated data set can be decomposed into a finite and often small number of ‘intrinsic mode functions’ that admit well-behaved Hilbert transforms. This decomposition method is adaptive, and, therefore, highly efficient. Since the decomposition is based on the local characteristic time scale of the data, it is applicable to nonlinear and non-stationary processes. With the Hilbert transform, the ‘instrinic mode functions’ yield instantaneous frequencies as functions of time that give sharp identifications of imbedded structures. The final presentation of the results is an energy-frequency-time distribution, designated as the Hilbert spectrum. In this method, the main conceptual innovations are the introduction of ‘intrinsic mode functions’ based on local properties of the signal, which make the instantaneous frequency meaningful; and the introduction of the instantaneous frequencies for complicated data sets, which eliminate the need for spurious harmonics to represent nonlinear and non-stationary signals. Examples from the numerical results of the classical nonlinear equation systems and data representing natural phenomena are given to demonstrate the power of this new method. Classical nonlinear system data are especially interesting, for they serve to illustrate the roles played by the nonlinear and non-stationary effects in the energy-frequency-time distribution. }},

    abstract = {{Summary Quantifying movement is critical for understanding animal behavior. Advances in computer vision now enable markerless tracking from 2D video, but most animals move in 3D. Here, we introduce Anipose, an open-source toolkit for robust markerless 3D pose estimation. Anipose is built on the 2D tracking method DeepLabCut, so users can expand their existing experimental setups to obtain accurate 3D tracking. It consists of four components: (1) a 3D calibration module, (2) filters to resolve 2D tracking errors, (3) a triangulation module that integrates temporal and spatial regularization, and (4) a pipeline to structure processing of large numbers of videos. We evaluate Anipose on a calibration board as well as mice, flies, and humans. By analyzing 3D leg kinematics tracked with Anipose, we identify a key role for joint rotation in motor control of fly walking. To help users get started with 3D tracking, we provide tutorials and documentation at http://anipose.org/.}},

In this paper we describe and validate XMALab, a new open-source software package for marker-based XROMM (C++ source and compiled versions on Bitbucket). Most marker-based XROMM studies to date have used XrayProject in MATLAB. XrayProject can produce results with excellent accuracy and precision, but it is somewhat cumbersome to use and requires a MATLAB license. We have designed XMALab to accelerate the XROMM process and to make it more accessible to new users. Features include the four XROMM steps (listed above) in one cohesive user interface, real-time plot windows for detecting errors, and integration with an online data management system, XMAPortal. Accuracy and precision of XMALab when tracking markers in a machined object are ±0.010 and ±0.043 mm, respectively. Mean precision for nine users tracking markers in a tutorial dataset of minipig feeding was ±0.062 mm in XMALab and ±0.14 mm in XrayProject. Reproducibility of 3D point locations across nine users was 10-fold greater in XMALab than in XrayProject, and six degree-of-freedom bone motions calculated with a joint coordinate system were 3- to 6-fold more reproducible in XMALab. XMALab is also suitable for tracking white or black markers in standard light videos with optional checkerboard calibration. We expect XMALab to increase both the quality and quantity of animal motion data available for comparative biomechanics research.}},

The primary outcome measure was the regularity of the stepping kinematics, which was assessed with Fourier analysis methods. The secondary measures were the preferred walking speed, step length, lower extremity strength and section E of the GMFM.Results: BWSTT improved the rhythmical control of the stepping kinematics, preferred walking speed, step length and GMFM score. The improvements in the regularity of the stepping kinematics were strongly correlated with changes in the preferred walking speed, step length and GMFM score.Conclusion: BWSTT can improve the motor control of the walk performance of children with CP. },

    abstract = {A case is made that motor performance and learning can be understood through hierarchical organization where an action plan is responsible for organizing relatively autonomous, lower order, units of activity. The action plan for movement is seen as consisting of information that systematically changes over learning as a function of the type of information the learner is attuned to. It is postulated that feedback about movement execution, specifically kinematic information, is the crucial source of information that supports the learning process. Data from two subjects, who practiced a sequential movement for 800 trials, did not support the idea that relatively autonomous units of activity serve as the basic building blocks for hierarchical motor control. Support was found for the idea that the subjects used displacement or spatial information early in acquisition, and then progressed to the use of velocity and perhaps acceleration information for the organization and control of their movements. Finally, a Fourier analysis of the data, as a function of practice, indicated subjects gradually modified their movements by progressively adding higher order harmonics to the fundamental harmonic of the movement which was established early in practice. Discussion of the results centered around the implications these results had for the hierarchical model of movement organization and the utility of adopting a Fourier synthesis/analysis approach to the study of motor learning.},

This variability appears to provide different information than the underlying periodic signal, particularly about fall risk. Most studies on variability have either used step-to-step metrics such as stride duration or point-wise standard deviations, neither of which explicitly capture the joint-level variability as a function of time. This work demonstrates that a second-order Fourier series for stance joints and a first-order Fourier series for swing joints can accurately capture the variability in joint angles as a function of time on a per-step basis for overground walking at the self-selected speed. It further demonstrates that a total of seven normal distributions, four linear relationships, and twelve continuity constraints can be used to describe how the Fourier series vary between steps. The ability of the proposed method to create curves that match human joint-level variability was evaluated both qualitatively and quantitatively using randomly generated curves.},

Promising moderately complex models have been developed using the robotics control technique called hybrid zero dynamics (HZD). Existing simulations of human walking only consider the mean motion; therefore, they cannot be used to investigate fall risk, which is correlated with variability. This study determines how to incorporate human-like variability into an HZD-based healthy human model to generate a more realistic gait. The key challenge is determining how to combine the existing mathematical description of variability with the dynamic model so that the biped is still able to walk without falling. To do so, the commanded motion is augmented with a sinusoidal variability function and a polynomial correction function. The variability function captures the variation in joint angles, while the correction function prevents the variability function from growing uncontrollably. The necessity of the correction function and the improvements with a reduction of stance ankle variability are demonstrated via simulations. The variability in temporal measures is shown to be similar to experimental values.},

Although this has been applied previously, it had not been noticed that the characteristic arrangement of Fourier coefficients in their complex-valued representation resembles landmarks in geometric morphometrics. We define a superimposition procedure in the frequency domain, which removes affine differences (mean, amplitude, phase) to reveal and compare the shape of periodic kinematic measures. This procedure is conceptually linked to dynamic similarity, which can thereby be assessed on the level of individual limb elements. We demonstrate how to make intralimb coordination accessible for large-scale, quantitative analyses. By applying this to a dataset from terrestrial ungulates, dominant patterns in forelimb coordination during walking are identified. This analysis shows that typical strides of these animals differ mostly in how much the limbs are lifted in the presence or absence of obstructive substrate features. This is shown to be independent of morphological features. Besides revealing fundamental characteristics of ungulate locomotion, we argue that the suggested method is generally suitable for the large-scale quantitative assessment of coordination and dynamics in periodic locomotor phenomena.},

Here, we present progressive tracking, a procedure that facilitates manual digitization of markerless videos. In contrast to existing software, it allows the user to follow points of interest with a cursor in the progressing video, without the need to click. To compare the performance of progressive tracking with the conventional frame-wise tracking, we quantified speed and accuracy of both methods, testing two different input devices (mouse and stylus pen). We show that progressive tracking can be twice as fast as frame-wise tracking while maintaining accuracy, given that playback speed is controlled. Using a stylus pen can increase frame-wise tracking speed. The complementary application of the progressive and frame-wise mode is exemplified on a realistic video recording. This study reveals that progressive tracking can vastly facilitate video analysis in experimental research.},

The experimental results and analysis represent that the proposed algorithm based on DFT can not only reduce the gait data dimensionality effectively, but also lightens the computation cost, with a satisfactory distinction. In order to make the algorithm more generic, a mean square error (MSE) analysis is also presented. Future work will be the expansion of the detection introduced in this system to include abnormality detection instead of just an abnormal or normal detection that would prove to be a valuable addition for use in a variety of applications, including unobtrusive clinical gait analysis, automated surveillance etc.},

The motion of the horse is recorded using a system for motion analysis (Selcom, 1983, SELSPOT II User Manual, Pad Nr. 6710) and the vertical motion of the head during both stance phases is compared. The symmetry is analyzed comparing the values of the Fourier coefficients. Additional had movements are ‘single events’ and present a problem. In this article we propose a mode of data processing using a system matched filter that neglects the nonperiodic additional movements and allows calculation of the representative Fourier coefficients. In comparison with a filtering method previously used in motion analysis this method is proved to be advantageous, as the precision of symmetry comparison increases.},

All segmental motions and ground reactions were predicted from only three simple gait descriptors (inputs): walking velocity, cycle period and double stance duration. Quantitative comparisons of the model predictions with gait measurements show that the model reproduced the significant characteristics of normal gait in the sagittal plane. The simulation results suggest that minimising energy expenditure is a primary control objective in normal walking. However, there is also some evidence for the existence of multiple concurrent performance objectives.},

Some of the properties of "ideal" systems which transmit at this maxmum rate are discussed. The equivalent number of binary digits per second for certain information sources is calculated.}},

    abstract = {We explore the use of Fourier series to describe the kinematics of human running. From a database of 285 trials of treadmill running, we drive a musculoskeletal model with 104 anatomical joint angles to obtain kinematics. Using FFT analysis, we determine a fundamental frequency for all independent joint angles and compute average step kinematics. Finally, we represent the average step kinematics using Fourier series with numbers of coefficient pairs ranging from one through ten. We find that five or fewer Fourier coefficient pairs provide an accurate (Pearson’s correlation > 0.99 and root mean square difference < 0.5 degrees) representation for most joint angles. In conclusion, Fourier series appear to provide a compact and valid representation of running kinematics, thus enabling researchers to confidently use Fourier series in research of human running.},

It is shown to have some desirable characteristics that are absent in the continuous wavelet transform. The S transform is unique in that it provides frequency-dependent resolution while maintaining a direct relationship with the Fourier spectrum. These advantages of the S transform are due to the fact that the modulating sinusoids are fixed with respect to the time axis, whereas the localizing scalable Gaussian window dilates and translates.}},

    abstract = {The objective of this study was to characterize joint angle variation across strides. Specifically, the statistical persistence of variations were quantified using the Hurst exponent. If a time series exhibits statistical persistence, then a parameter which is smaller (or larger) than average will tend to be followed by additional values that are also smaller (or larger) than average. Human walking has statistical persistence between stride durations. Variation in stride duration must arise from variation in the motion of the leg segments during walking. It is unclear, however, if the joint angle variation also exhibits statistical persistence. This study examined kinematic data collected from nine healthy adults walking for 10 min at a self-selected comfortable speed on a treadmill. The joint angle variation in the lower limbs was parameterized using first-order Fourier series which in turn were described by frequency and magnitude coefficients for each stride. To determine if the joint angle variation exhibited statistical persistence, the Hurst exponent was found for each coefficient at each joint. The mean Hurst exponents were 0.54 for the frequency coefficients and 0.61 for the magnitude coefficients. Neither the frequency or magnitude coefficients exhibited statistically significant persistence, although some of the magnitude coefficients were close to reaching statistical significance. This suggests that joint angle variability in healthy adults does not directly produce the statistical persistence observed in stride duration fluctuations.},

    abstract = {General mathematical models are presented to be used in equine kinematic gait analysis for the correction of the biological error that is caused by sliding of the skin over the underlying bony landmarks. Ten sites in the front limb and 8 in the hind limb were investigated. In the distal parts of the limbs a linear relationship with the angle of the adjacent joint was found. The more complex pattern in the proximal parts of the limbs could be satisfactorily represented by truncated Fourier series. Analyses were principally done in the Dutch Warmblood horse, but investigations in other breeds were carried out to verify the general applicability of the models. Skin displacement appeared to be negligible in the lower parts of the limbs, but reached large values in proximally located sites such as the caudal part of the greater trochanter of the femur. It is concluded that skin displacement in equine gait analysis may account for major errors in applied biomechanical research and therefore should be corrected, although it may be of less importance for clinical applications.},

    abstract = {To describe and help interpret joint movements in various forms of primate locomotion, we explored the use of Fourier analysis to represent changing joint angles as a series of sine and cosine curves added together to approximate the raw angular data. Results are presented for four joints (shoulder, elbow, hip and knee) with emphasis on the shoulder, and for five types of locomotion (catarhine primate quadrupedal walking, human hands-and-feet creeping and hands-and-knees creeping, and human walking and running). Fourier analysis facilitates functional interpretation of the angles of all four joints, by providing average joint angles and an indication of the number of peaks and troughs in the angular data. The description of limb movements also afforded us the opportunity to compare human and other catarhine joint angles, and we interpret the Fourier results in terms of locomotor posture and type. In addition, the shoulder data are useful for determination of some aspects of interlimb coordination. Non-human primates walking quadrupedally and humans creeping on hands and knees generally evince diagonal couplets interlimb coordination, in which the hand on one side strikes the substrate at about the same time as the contralateral foot or knee. Furthermore, human walking and running seem to follow a similar pattern, as indicated by Fourier analysis. From our data it is concluded that human bipedal gaits are qualitatively similar to diagonal couplets gaits in other primates, but quite different from the lateral couplets gaits used by many non-primate mammals. A number of other benefits of Fourier analysis in primate locomotion studies are also discussed. These include the ability to make statistical comparisons among various types of limb movements in a wide variety of species, a simple archival technique for limb movement data, and a greater understanding of the variability of locomotor movements.},
