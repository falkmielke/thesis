Henderson, Behavior of the norta method for correlated random vector generation as the dimension increases, ACM Transactions on Modeling and Computer Simulation (TOMACS) 13 (3) (2003) 276–294] and the recently proposed method of Joe [H. Joe, Generating random correlation matrices based on partial correlations, Journal of Multivariate Analysis 97 (2006) 2177–2189] based on partial correlations. The latter is based on the so-called D-vine. We extend the methodology to any regular vine and study the relationship between the multiple correlation and partial correlations on a regular vine. We explain the onion method in terms of elliptical distributions and extend it to allow generating random correlation matrices from the same joint distribution as the vine method. The methods are compared in terms of time necessary to generate 5000 random correlation matrices of given dimensions.}

    abstract = "{Many phenomena related to motor behaviour in animals are spatially and temporally periodic, making them accessible for transformation to the frequency domain via Fourier Series. Although this has been applied previously, it had not been noticed that the characteristic arrangement of Fourier coefficients in their complex-valued representation resembles landmarks in geometric morphometrics. We define a superimposition procedure in the frequency domain, which removes affine differences (mean, amplitude, phase) to reveal and compare the shape of periodic kinematic measures. This procedure is conceptually linked to dynamic similarity, which can thereby be assessed on the level of individual limb elements. We demonstrate how to make intralimb coordination accessible for large-scale, quantitative analyses. By applying this to a dataset from terrestrial ungulates, dominant patterns in forelimb coordination during walking are identified. This analysis shows that typical strides of these animals differ mostly in how much the limbs are lifted in the presence or absence of obstructive substrate features. This is shown to be independent of morphological features. Besides revealing fundamental characteristics of ungulate locomotion, we argue that the suggested method is generally suitable for the large-scale quantitative assessment of coordination and dynamics in periodic locomotor phenomena.}",

    abstract = {Abstract While the Bayesian parameter estimation has gained a wider acknowledgement among political scientists, they seem to have less discussed the Bayesian version of hypothesis testing. This paper introduces two Bayesian approaches to hypothesis testing: one based on estimated posterior distributions and the other based on Bayes factors. By using an example based on a linear regression model, I demonstrate similarities and differences not only between the null-hypothesis significance tests and Bayesian hypothesis tests, but also those among two different Bayesian approaches, which are also critically discussed.},
