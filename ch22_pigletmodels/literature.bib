    abstract = {{Abstract Spatio-temporal gait characteristics (step and stride length, stride frequency, duty factor) were determined for the hind-limb cycles of nine bonobos (Pan paniscus) walking quadrupedally and bipedally at a range of speeds. The data were recalculated to dimensionless quantities according to the principle of dynamic similarity. Lower leg length was used as the reference length. Interindividual variability in speed modulation strategy of bonobos appears to be low. Compared to quadrupedal walking, bipedal bonobos use smaller steps to attain a given speed (differences increase with speed), resulting in shorter strides at a higher frequency. In the context of the (“hybrid”) dynamic pattern approach to locomotion (Latach, 1998) we argue that, despite these absolute differences, intended walking speed is the basic control variable which elicits both quadrupedal and bipedal walking kinematics in a similar way. Differences in the initial status of the dynamic system may be responsible for the differences in step length between both gaits. Comparison with data deduced from the literature shows that the effects of walking speed on stride length and frequency are similar in bonobos, common chimpanzees, and humans. This suggests that (at least) within extant homininae, spatio-temporal gait characteristics are highly comparable, and this in spite of obvious differences in mass distribution and bipedal posture.

    abstract = {The dynamic similarity hypothesis postulates that different mammals move in a dynamically similar fashion whenever they travel at speeds that give them equal values of a dimensionless parameter, the Froude number. Thus, given information about one species, it could be possible to predict for others relationships between size, speed and features of gait such as stride length, duty factor, the phase relationships of the feet and the patterns of force exerted on the ground. Data for a diverse sample of mammals have been used to test the hypothesis. It is found to be tenable in many cases when comparisons are confined to quadrupedal mammals of the type described by Jenkins (1971) as “cursorial”. Most mammals of mass greater than 5 kg are of this type. Although the hypothesis applies less successfully to comparisons between cursorial and non-cursorial mammals it is shown to be a reasonable approximation even for such comparisons and for comparisons between quadrupedal mammals and bipedal mammals and birds.},

    abstract = {The increasing litter sizes of modern pig breeds have led to a significant number of piglets that are born undersized (“small” piglets) and some have been exposed to different degrees of intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR). The aim of this study was to investigate the physiology and capability to ingest colostrum of these small piglets, suffering from various degrees of IUGR, to see if their IUGR score could be a useful tool for easy identification of piglets in need of intervention in the colostrum period. Piglets were classified at birth based on head morphology. Piglets were classified either “normal,” “mildly IUGR” (m-IUGR), or “severe IUGR” (s-IUGR), based on head morphology. Blood samples were collected at birth and at 24 h, and colostrum intake during two 12-h periods and blood metabolites at 0 and 24 h were measured. At 24 h, piglets weighing \\&lt;900 g at birth and the median piglet in birth order were sacrificed, and organ weights and hepatic glycogen were measured. Overall, there was an influence of the piglets' classification on most characteristics, with normal piglets having a greater colostrum intake between 0 and 12 h (P \\&lt; 0.001) and between 12 and 24 h (P \\&lt; 0.05), and higher birth weight, crown rump length, body mass index, and ponderal index (P \\&lt; 0.001), and a tendency toward a higher vitality score (P \\&lt; 0.069) than s-IUGR piglets. There was a time × IUGR interaction, with plasma glucose levels being lowered (P \\&lt; 0.001) and lactate levels elevated (P \\&lt; 0.001) in s-IUGR piglets at 24 h compared with normal and m-IUGR piglets. Some differences were found in electrolytes; sodium plasma concentrations were greatest for normal piglets (P \\&lt; 0.05) and highest at 0 h (P \\&lt; 0.05). At 24 h of age, s-IUGR piglets had a higher heart (P \\&lt; 0.001) and brain percentage (P \\&lt; 0.001), and a lower liver percentage (P \\&lt; 0.001) relative to body weight, compared with normal piglets. In addition, s-IUGR piglets had less hepatic glycogen than m-IUGR piglets and normal piglets. The present study showed that the physiology of piglets in the colostrum period was affected by IUGR status at birth and their intermediary metabolism was altered due to different colostrum intakes. Furthermore, it was demonstrated that the head shape of newborn piglets is a good selection criteria for identifying piglets that need oral supplementation during the neonatal stage.},

In preterm infants, many physiological deficits adapt and disappear with advancing postnatal age, but some may persist into childhood. We hypothesized that preterm birth would induce impaired organ growth and function during the first postnatal week in pigs, while motor abilities and behavioral characteristics would show more persistent developmental delay. Cesarean-delivered preterm (n = 112, 90\% gestation) or term (n = 56, 100\% gestation) piglets were reared under identical conditions and euthanized for blood and organ collection on postnatal days 0, 5, or 26. Body weight gain remained lower in preterm vs. term pigs up to day 26 (25.5 ± 1.5 vs. 31.0 ± 0.5 g·kg−1·day−1, P < 0.01) when relative weights were higher for brain and kidneys and reduced for liver and spleen. Neonatal preterm pigs had reduced values for blood pH, Po2, glucose, lactate, hematocrit, and cortisol, but at day 26, most values were normalized, although plasma serotonin and IGF 1 levels remained reduced. Preterm pigs showed delayed neonatal arousal and impaired physical activity, coordination, exploration, and learning, relative to term pigs (all P < 0.05). Supplementation of parenteral nutrition during the first 5 days with an enteral milk diet did not affect later outcomes. In preterm pigs, many physiological characteristics of immaturity disappeared by 4 wk, while some neurodevelopmental deficits remained. The preterm pig is a relevant animal model to study early dietary and pharmacological interventions that support postnatal maturation and neurodevelopment in preterm infants.},

Furthermore, with this minimum number of SPV, the standard errors of the regression coefficients were accurately estimated and estimated confidence intervals had approximately the advertised coverage rates. A much higher number of SPV were necessary to minimize bias in estimating the model R2, although adjusted R2 estimates behaved well. The bias in estimating the model R2 statistic was inversely proportional to the magnitude of the proportion of variation explained by the population regression model.; Conclusion: Linear regression models require only two SPV for adequate estimation of regression coefficients, standard errors, and confidence intervals.},

We investigated the molecular mechanisms of the altered intestinal maturation observed in neonatal and juvenile LBW female piglets by comparing the changes in intestinal morphology, gene expression, and methylation in LBW versus normal birth weight (NBW) female piglets. A total of 16 LBW/NBW sibling pairs were sacrificed at 0 hours, 8 hours, 10 days, and 8 weeks of age. The gastrointestinal tract was weighed, measured, and the small intestine was sampled for histomorphology, gene expression, and methylation analyses. Impaired intestinal development, with shorter villi and shallower crypts, was observed in LBW female piglets. The expression of intestinal development markers (ALPI and OLFM) rapidly peaked after birth in NBW but not in LBW female piglets. The lower expression of genes involved in nutrient digestion (ANPEP and SI) and barrier function (OCLN and CLDN4) in LBW, together with their delayed development of intestinal villi and crypts could help to explain the compromised health and growth potential of LBW female piglets. The changes in methylation observed in LBW in key regulators of intestinal development (OLFM4 and FZD5) suggest long-term effects of BW on intestinal gene expression, development, and function. Accordingly, experimental demethylation induced in IPEC-J2 cells led to increased expression of intestinal genes (MGA, DPP4, and GLUT2). Overall, we have identified the alterations in transcription or epigenetic marking at a number of genes critical to intestinal development, which may contribute to both the short- and long-term failure of LBW female piglets to thrive.},

    abstract = {{Lameness is a major production disease affecting animal welfare and profitability. Although lameness is a prevalent condition in livestock production systems, its identification can be unreliable due to lack of individual animal observation for gait and posture abnormalities and standard evaluation criteria. To prevent financial losses and welfare problems, early and accurate lameness detection and treatment are essential. Visual scoring is the most common method to evaluate lameness, which is time and labor involved and is prone to observer error. Therefore, automated lameness detection methods that do not rely on the human eyes and are not subjective may offer a more accurate lameness identification method. Application of engineering techniques in livestock farming to monitor, model, and manage animal production is called precision livestock farming (PLF). Using PLF, a large amount of data can be collected in short period of time, which can improve lameness prediction accuracy. This review paper will (a) explain engineering advances in PLF; (b) describe lameness and visual and automatic lameness detection; and (c) discuss sensors applied in PLF research.}},

Our aim was to identify additional behavioural and physiological indicators of piglet survival incorporating traits reflective of both the intrauterine and extrauterine environment. Data were collected from 135 piglets from 10 Large White×Landrace sows to investigate which physiological measurements (e.g. individual placental traits), and which behavioural measurements (e.g. the quantification of piglet vigour), were the best indicators of piglet survival. Generalised linear models confirmed piglet birth weight as a critical survival factor. However, with respect to stillborn mortality, piglet shape and size, as measured by ponderal index (birth weight/(crown–rump length)3), body mass index (birth weight/(crown–rump length)2), respectively, and farrowing birth order were better indicators. With respect to live-born mortality, postnatal survival factors identified as crucial were birth weight, vigour independent of birth weight, and the latency to first suckle. These results highlight the importance of the intrauterine environment for postnatal physiological and behavioural adaptation and identify additional factors influencing piglet neonatal survival.},

One interesting, and often discussed, aspect of mortality is the propensity for it to be sex-biased. This study investigated whether known physiological and behavioural indicators of piglet survival differed between the sexes and whether life history strategies (often reported in wild or feral populations) relating to parental investment were being displayed in a domestic population of pigs. Sex ratio (proportion of males (males/males+females)) at birth was 0.54 and sex allocation (maternal investment measured as piglet birth weight/litter weight) was statistically significantly male-biased at 0.55 (t35 = 2.51 P = 0.017), suggesting that sows invested more in sons than daughters during gestation. Despite this investment in birth weight, a known survival indicator, total pre-weaning male mortality was statistically significantly higher than female mortality (12\% vs. 7\% respectively z = 2.06 P = 0.040). Males tended to suffer from crushing by the sow more than females and statistically significantly more males died from disease-related causes. Although males were born on average heavier, with higher body mass index and ponderal index, these differences were not sustained. In addition male piglets showed impaired thermoregulation compared to females. These results suggest male-biased mortality exists despite greater initial maternal investment, and therefore reflects the greater susceptibility of this sex to causal mortality factors. Life history strategies are being displayed by a domestic population of pigs with sows in this study displaying a form of parental optimism by allocating greater resources at birth to males and providing an over-supply of this more vulnerable sex in expectation of sex-biased mortality.},

Little support for sex-specific lower limb kinematic patterns was found in 17 studies retrieved on landing and hopping. Ten studies retrieved on muscle activation during landing provided no support for sex-specific patterns. Four articles retrieved on leg stiffness established that absolute stiffness was lower in females, but differences in stiffness normalized to body mass were less clear. The wider literature indicates that a combination of biological, environmental and sociocultural constraints may shape movement patterns differently in females and males. Sociocultural factors differentially affect accumulated motor experience, practice opportunities and focus of attention in females, leading to differences in motor skill that confound the comparison of female and male movements. The findings of the review support the hypothesis that such sex differences in athletic performance are likely to diminish or disappear with increasing skill. In everyday movement tasks, however, where level of skill is a less meaningful dimension than in sport, differences in movement patterns observed between females and males point instead to the influence of subtle societal expectations on movement patterns.},

Reduced costs of technology such as thermal videography and unmanned aerial vehicles has made video-based animal tracking more accessible, however existing software for processing acquired video limits the application of these methods.Here, we present a novel software program for high-throughput 2-D and 3-D animal tracking. ThruTracker provides tools to allow video tracking under a variety of conditions with minimal technical expertise or coding background and without the need for paid licenses. Notable capabilities include calibrating the intrinsic properties of thermal cameras; tracking and counting hundreds of animals at a time; and the ability to make 3-D calibrations without dedicated calibration objects. Automated 2-D and 3-D workflows are integrated to allow for analysis of largescale datasets.We tested ThruTracker with two case studies. The 2-D workflow is demonstrated by counting bats emerging from bridges and caves using thermal Videography. Tests show that ThruTracker has a similar accuracy compared to humans under a variety of conditions. The 3-D workflow is shown for making accurate calibrations for tracking bats and birds at wind turbines using only the wind turbine itself as a calibration object.ThruTracker is a robust software program for tracking moving animals in 2-D and 3-D. Major applications include counting animals such as bats, birds, and fish that form large aggregations, and documenting movement trajectories over medium spatial scales (\~{}100,000 m3). When combined with emerging technologies, we expect videographic techniques to continue to see widespread adoption for an increasing range of biological applications.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

    abstract = {Investigating variability of scores between different observers, between animals and over time aids the design of valid sampling methodologies for measuring animal welfare. Locomotion scores (0 to 5 scale) were collected: i) from 154 sows in one herd, using three to five observers each time, and scoring sows on up to ten occasions over a 19-month period; and ii) for 123 of these sows, locomotion scoring also took place prior to farrowing and at weaning. The distribution of scores was highly skewed towards low scores (0: 84.8\%, 1: 9.5\%, 2: 4.0\%, 3+: 1.7\%). Sows showed moderate consistency in their scores over time and later parity sows had higher scores, but there was no effect of stage in the reproductive cycle (days pregnant, pre-farrowing, post-weaning). This suggests that infrequent visits to a farm (eg annual) might provide an accurate estimate of the extent of lameness if a representative range of parities was sampled, although a larger study of more farms would be required to investigate this. The three different types of agreement between observers (absolute differences, matching and association) were assessed as follows: i) analysis of absolute differences between observers showed that the farm manager scored lower than researchers/technicians; ii) exact matching approaches suggested fair or good agreement agreement was poorest for mild gait abnormalities (score 1 'stiff'), and agreement improved if scores were combined into 'sound' (01) and 'lame' (25) categories; and iii) measures of association suggested moderate agreement. Inter-observer reliability improved over time until the 5th scoring event. To improve inter-observer agreement, observer training/practice and the use of fewer categories are recommended, and inter-observer agreement should be checked regularly.},

Slatted concrete floors are commonly used for effective drainage of manure but can cause feet injuries and lameness. In the present study, kinematics were used to characterize the gait of 12 gilts and 12 lame sows walking in a corridor on slatted concrete floors with different combinations of slat (85, 105 or 125 mm) and gap (19, 22 or 25 mm) widths. The nine experimental floors were tested with slats in the perpendicular and parallel orientation to the direction of animal walk, according to a duplicated lattice design. Gait parameters were quantified using spatial, temporal and angular kinematics for front and rear limbs. Some parameters were significantly affected by the treatments (p &lt; 0.05), but the effects differed between gilts and lame sows and between slat orientations. Gap width had a significant effect on parameters such as back angle, stride length, foot height, and carpal and tarsal joint angle amplitudes. Slat width significantly affected parameters such as foot height, and carpal and tarsal joint angle amplitudes. Comparisons of the different combinations of slat and gap widths revealed that slats with a width of 105–125 mm and gap width of 19–22 mm had the least effect on the gait characteristics of the gilts and sows.},

    abstract = {Performance of pigs from birth to slaughter is a result of a complex interaction of factors, with the early stages of a pig's life likely to affect lifetime performance. During the preweaning stage, piglets are reliant on the sow for nutrition, and sibling competition is likely to affect growth, in particular for low birth weight (LBiW) piglets. The objective of the experiment was to determine the effect of litter composition (littermate weight) and milk supplementation during lactation on the performance of LBiW pigs to weaning and the long-term consequences of treatment to slaughter. The experiment was a 2 × 2 factorial with littermate weight (normal or LBiW) and provision of supplementary milk from d 1 to 28 (yes or no) as factors. A total of 265 piglets were selected within 24 h of birth and cross-fostered to create 2 litter types (LOW = LBiW pigs [≤1.25 kg] only and MX = both LBiW and normal birth weight pigs [1.6 to 2.0 kg]); half of the litters within a type were supplemented with milk and the other half were not. The behavior of litters given milk was recorded to identify milk consumption patterns. Piglets were weaned at d 28 and kept in their litters until d 70 and then subsequently housed in mixed groups until slaughter. No difference was observed at any stage in the ADG of pigs given access to supplementary milk or not (P \\&gt; 0.05) nor was there any significant interaction between milk provision and litter composition (P \\&gt; 0.05). However, LOW litters drank significantly more supplementary milk than MX litters (P \\&lt; 0.001). There was a significant effect of litter type on ADG from d 14 to 28, with LBiW pigs in LOW litters performing better than those in MX litters (0.252 versus 0.217 kg/d; P \\&lt; 0.05). At weaning, LBiW piglets in LOW litters weighed over 500 g more than those in MX litters (P \\&lt; 0.05). In MX litters there was a significant interaction between birth weight and supplementary milk on the CV of BW from d 14 to slaughter (P \\&lt; 0.05). In conclusion, grouping LBiW piglets with similar sized littermates preweaning can improve preweaning performance by reducing competition from heavier littermates; however, this advantage does not persist after weaning. Although supplementary milk does not improve LBiW pig performance before or after weaning, it affects their drinking behavior and can reduce the variation in the BW of LBiW piglets in mixed litters to slaughter.},

    abstract = {Objective Although extant nonhuman primates are not habitual bipeds, they are able to walk bipedally from an early age. In humans, children improve their walking skills through developmental processes and learning experience. In nonhuman primates, infants do not routinely experience bipedalism and their musculoskeletal system gradually specializes for other locomotor modes. The aim of this study is to explore the development of occasional bipedal walking in olive baboon and to test whether the postural adjustments change with age. Materials and Methods We collected kinematics and spatiotemporal parameters of bipedal gait in an ontogenetic sample of 24 baboons. Data were collected at the primatology station of the CNRS (France) and a total of 47 bipedal strides were extracted for the present analysis. Results Adults and adolescents walk bipedally in the same way, and the average kinematic pattern is similar across the age-classes. Infants walk bipedally with longer duty factor, they present larger movement amplitude of the thigh and the amplitude of the knee joint decreases with speed. In contrast, older baboons increase the amplitude of the knee and ankle joints with speed. Discussion In a non-adapted biped, the postural adjustments of bipedal walking vary with age. In infant baboons, the balance requirements are likely to be higher and these are solved by adopting a “blocking strategy”. In older baboons, the postural adjustments are focused on the lower limb and the movements increase with speed. These results may echo, in some respects, the developmental sequence of the intersegmental coordination described in the ontogeny of human locomotion.}

    abstract = { The evolutionary biology of the pig means that it is predisposed to produce more offspring than it is likely to rear, and this tendency has been exacerbated under farm conditions by genetic selection pressure for increased prolificacy. Piglet mortality from birth to weaning typically amounts to 16-20\%, with the major causes attributed to stillbirth, crushing and starvation. However, these ultimate causes mask the true predisposing factors, with interactive risk factors arising from the biology of the sow and piglets and the challenges of the neonatal environment. Intra-uterine competition for nutrients can result in a stillborn piglet or a live-born piglet with reduced viability, low birth weight and compromised chances for postnatal survival. Prenatal insults can impact on vigour and thermoregulatory abilities, resulting in a piglet unable to survive the challenges of asphyxia during birth, hypothermia following delivery and intense competition for colostrum. Reduction in piglet mortality requires co-ordinated genetic, nutritional, management and stockperson interventions. The incorporation of survival traits in genetic selection goals, the optimisation of maternal nutrition during breeding and gestation, and the avoidance of prenatal maternal stress through appropriate environmental conditions will promote delivery of more vital piglets and stimulate good maternal behaviour. Supervision and assistance during farrowing, with stockperson intervention to facilitate early and adequate ingestion of colostrum by all piglets, provision of appropriate thermal microclimates to reduce hypothermia, and skilful cross-fostering to ensure early establishment of litters of appropriate size and uniformity, are all key components of success. With an increasing societal focus on the ethical and welfare issues in pig production, but no alleviation of the financial pressures on pig farmers to remain competitive, the requirement to achieve a high number of piglets weaned per sow per year in an environment allowing adequate expression of sow behavioural needs will continue to pose challenges. }

    abstract = {Newborn piglets have a high incidence of preweaning mortality that is not only associated with low birth weights but also with the presence of intra-uterine growth-restricted (IUGR) piglets. Such IUGR piglets are commonly seen in litters from hyperprolific sows as a result of insufficient placental transfer of nutrients. Nutritional strategies can be used prior to and during gestation to enhance foetal development and can also be implemented in the transition period to reduce the duration of farrowing and increase colostrum yield. Recent findings showed that the energy status of sows at the onset of farrowing is crucial to diminish stillbirth rate. Newborn piglets often fail to consume enough colostrum to promote thermostability and subsequent growth, and this is particularly problematic in very large litters when there are fewer available teats than the number of suckling piglets. One injection of 75 IU of oxytocin approximately 14 h after farrowing can prolong the colostral phase, hence increasing the supply of immunoglobulins to piglets. Nevertheless, assistance must be provided to piglets after birth in order to increase their chance of survival. Various approaches can be used, such as: (1) optimising the farrowing environment, (2) supervising farrowing and assisting newborn piglets, (3) using cross-fostering techniques, (4) providing nurse sows, and 5) providing artificial milk. Although research advances have been made in developing feeding and management strategies for sows that increase performance of their newborn piglets, much work still remains to be done to ensure that maximal outcomes are achieved.}

Thus, the objective of the current work was to identify a birth weight threshold value for preweaning mortality. Birth weight and survival data from two studies involving a combined total of 4,068 piglets from 394 litters on four commercial farms (three European, one U.S.) were compiled for a pooled, multistudy analysis. Overall preweaning mortality across the two studies was 12.2\%. Key variables used in the analysis were piglet birth weight (measured within 24 h of birth) and corresponding survival outcome (dead or live) by weaning at 3–4 wk of age. A mixed effects logistic regression model was fit to estimate the relationship between preweaning mortality and birth weight. A random effect of study was included to account for overall differences in mortality between the two studies. A piecewise linear predictor was selected to best represent the drastic decrease in preweaning mortality found as birth weight increased in the range of 0.5–1.0 kg and the less extreme change in weight above 1.0 kg. The change point of the birth weight and preweaning mortality model was determined by comparing model fit based on maximizing the likelihood over the interval ranging from 0.5 to 2.3 kg birth weight. Results from the analysis showed a curvilinear relationship between birth weight and preweaning mortality where the birth weight change point value or threshold value was 1.11 kg. In the combined data set, 15.2\% of pigs had birth weights ≤1.11 kg. This subpopulation of pigs had a 34.4\% preweaning mortality rate and represented 43\% of total preweaning mortalities. These findings imply interventions targeted at reducing the incidence of piglets with birth weights ≤1.11 kg have potential to improve piglet survivability. Additional research is needed to validate 1.11 kg as the birth weight threshold for increased risk of preweaning mortality.},

The system classifies and quantifies motion-based animal behaviour and daily activity in video sequences, allowing automated and non-intrusive surveillance in real-time. The aim of this system is to evaluate significant changes in animals’ motion after being experimentally infected with ASF virus. Indeed, pig mobility declined progressively and fell significantly below pre-infection levels starting at four days after infection at a confidence level of 95%. Furthermore, daily motion decreased in infected animals by approximately 10% before the detection of the disease by clinical signs. These results show the promise of video processing techniques for real-time early detection of livestock infectious diseases.},

The aim of this review was to explore the capacity of existing PLF technologies to contribute to the assessment of pig welfare. In a web search for commercially available PLF for pigs, 83 technologies were identified. A literature search was conducted, following systematic review guidelines (PRISMA), to identify studies on the validation of sensor technologies for assessing animal-based welfare indicators. Two validation levels were defined: internal (evaluation during system building within the same population that were used for system building) and external (evaluation on a different population than during system building). From 2,463 articles found, 111 were selected, which validated some PLF that could be applied to the assessment of animal-based welfare indicators of pigs (7\% classified as external, and 93\% as internal validation). From our list of commercially available PLF technologies, only 5\% had been externally validated. The more often validated technologies were vision-based solutions (n = 45), followed by load-cells (n = 28; feeders and drinkers, force plates and scales), accelerometers (n = 14) and microphones (n = 14), thermal cameras (n = 10), photoelectric sensors (n = 5), radio-frequency identification (RFID) for tracking (n = 2), infrared thermometers (n = 1), and pyrometer (n = 1). Externally validated technologies were photoelectric sensors (n = 2), thermal cameras (n = 2), microphone (n = 1), load-cells (n = 1), RFID (n = 1), and pyrometer (n = 1). Measured traits included activity and posture-related behavior, feeding and drinking, other behavior, physical condition, and health. In conclusion, existing PLF technologies are potential tools for on-farm animal welfare assessment in pig production. However, validation studies are lacking for an important percentage of market available tools, and in particular research and development need to focus on identifying the feature candidates of the measures (e.g., deviations from diurnal pattern, threshold levels) that are valid signals of either negative or positive animal welfare. An important gap identified are the lack of technologies to assess affective states (both positive and negative states).},

Piglets were categorized into groups according to their survivability: surviving to weaning (SURV), stillborn (STILL), or dead between birth and weaning (DBW), which was subdivided into dead d 0 to 1 after farrowing (DEAD1) or dead d 2 to 26 after farrowing (DEAD26). Linear models were used to determine which physical characteristics affected survivability and growth of piglets. Results showed that characteristics related to the individual piglets had a greater degree of explanatory power in relation to survival than variables related to the sow. Survival of piglets increased if piglets were females (P \\&lt; 0.001), had a greater body mass index (P \\&lt; 0.001), and were born to sows of parity 3 or more (P = 0.017). Piglets with a greater birth weight were more likely to survive (P \\&lt; 0.001), but birth weight was inferior to body mass index in explaining differences between SURV and DBW. Piglets that died 2 to 26 d after birth had a lower birth weight (P \\&lt; 0.001), were born to sows of parity 1 or 2 (P = 0.014), and were born after a shorter gestation (P = 0.011) compared with SURV. Piglets that died on d 0 to 1 after birth had a lower body mass index (P \\&lt; 0.001), displayed a greater degree of growth restriction (P = 0.004), and were born in large litters (P = 0.005). The gender of the piglets affected survivability at both d 0 to 1 (P \\&lt; 0.001) and d 2 to 26 (P \\&lt; 0.001). Piglets in DEAD1 differed from STILL by having a shorter crown to rump length (P \\&lt; 0.001), a birth weight that deviated more from the mean weight of the litter (P = 0.001), and being more likely to be born before d 116 of gestation (P = 0.008). The only physical characteristic that was important for growth performance in the suckling period was birth weight (P \\&lt; 0.001), yet using only birth weight as an indicator for survivability was too simplistic. The results of this study emphasize that individual characteristics of neonatal piglets could serve as indicators of survivability of piglets born in noncrate systems; however, the results suggest that the importance of characteristics differed in different periods of the preweaning period.},

Thus, we quantified the three-dimensional kinematics of the hindlimb, body and tail for five morphologically distinct species of lizard during steady-speed locomotion near maximum sprinting speed (2–5 m s-1). The kinematics of different species had little multivariate overlap. More than half of the strides of all species had digitigrade foot posture, but the frequency of using digitigrade foot posture varied among species. The combination of digitigrade foot posture and large foot size of the lizards contributed substantially to the high values of hip height. For each species, different suites of kinematic variables distinguished bipedal from quadrupedal strides. Interspecific morphological variation did not correspond globally to variation in kinematics, although lizard species with elongated hindlimbs took longer strides than species with shorter hindlimbs. The Froude numbers and relative stride lengths of all lizards running near maximal speeds were large compared with those reported previously for other vertebrates.}},

Anipose is built on the 2D tracking method DeepLabCut, so users can expand their existing experimental setups to obtain accurate 3D tracking. It consists of four components: (1) a 3D calibration module, (2) filters to resolve 2D tracking errors, (3) a triangulation module that integrates temporal and spatial regularization, and (4) a pipeline to structure processing of large numbers of videos. We evaluate Anipose on a calibration board as well as mice, flies, and humans. By analyzing 3D leg kinematics tracked with Anipose, we identify a key role for joint rotation in motor control of fly walking.

Its composition in electrolytes, hormones and especially its proteome contains information about feeding status, nutritional requirements and adaptations to diet and environment, and also about health status of animals. It is easy to collect on a non-invasive and routine basis without any need for special training. Therefore, the analysis of salivary proteomes is going to emerge into a field of high interest with the future goal to maintain and improve livestock productivity and welfare. Moreover, the comprehensive analysis and identification of salivary proteins and peptides in whole and glandular saliva is a necessary pre-requisite to identify animal disease biomarkers and a powerful tool to better understand animal physiology. This review focuses on the different approaches used to study the salivary proteomes of farm animals, in respect to the physiology of nutrition and food perception in relation to food choices. The potential of animal saliva as a source of disease biomarkers will also be pointed out. Special emphasis is laid on the ‘ruminating triad’ – cattle, goat and sheep – as well as swine as major species of animal production in Western and Southern Europe.

In the first experiment 198 litters were recorded in three systems, two of which allowed the sows to move freely, and the third restricted them in conventional crates. More piglets were weaned from the conventional crates than from the open systems and they grew more quickly. More than half the liveborn mortality occurred during the first four days after parturition. In the open systems, 17 per cent and 14 per cent of the piglets born alive were crushed, compared with only 8 per cent in the crates. In the second experiment, 29 sows and litters were studied in detail in a communal pen system during the first seven days of lactation. Three-quarters of the liveborn mortality was due to crushing. The total number of piglets dying per litter, including stillbirths, was significantly associated with the total litter size and the sow's parity. The percentage livebom mortality was significantly associated with the parity and body length of the sows and with the within-litter variation in the birth weight of the piglets. Individual birth weight was closely associated with percentage survival. Only 28 per cent of piglets weighing less than 1.1 kg at birth survived to seven days.},

Despite the increasing availability of hierarchical model frameworks for statistical analyses, they have not been applied extensively to comparative motion analysis. As a case study for the use of hierarchical models, we analyzed locomotor parameters of four Swinhoe’s striped squirrels. The small-bodied arboreal mammals exhibit brief bouts of rapid asymmetric gaits. Spatio-temporal parameters on runways with experimentally varied dimensions of the setup enclosure were compared to test for their potentially confounding effects. We applied principal component analysis to evaluate changes to the overall locomotor pattern. A common, non-hierarchical, pooled statistical analysis of the data revealed significant differences in some of the parameters depending on enclosure dimensions. In contrast, we used a hierarchical Bayesian generalized linear model (GLM) that considers subject specific differences and population effects to compare the effect of enclosure dimensions on the measured parameters and the principal components. None of the population effects were confirmed by the hierarchical GLM. The confounding effect of a single subject that deviates in its locomotor behavior is potentially bigger than the influence of the experimental variation in enclosure dimensions. Our findings justify the common practice of researchers to intuitively select an enclosure with dimensions assumed as “non-constraining”. Hierarchical models can easily be designed to cope with limited sample size and bias introduced by deviating behavior of individuals. When limited data is available—a typical restriction of in-vivo motion analyses of non-model organisms—density distributions of the Bayesian GLM used here remain reliable and the hierarchical structure of the model optimally exploits all available information. We provide code to be adjusted to other research questions.},

Although this has been applied previously, it had not been noticed that the characteristic arrangement of Fourier coefficients in their complex-valued representation resembles landmarks in geometric morphometrics. We define a superimposition procedure in the frequency domain, which removes affine differences (mean, amplitude, phase) to reveal and compare the shape of periodic kinematic measures. This procedure is conceptually linked to dynamic similarity, which can thereby be assessed on the level of individual limb elements. We demonstrate how to make intralimb coordination accessible for large-scale, quantitative analyses. By applying this to a dataset from terrestrial ungulates, dominant patterns in forelimb coordination during walking are identified. This analysis shows that typical strides of these animals differ mostly in how much the limbs are lifted in the presence or absence of obstructive substrate features. This is shown to be independent of morphological features. Besides revealing fundamental characteristics of ungulate locomotion, we argue that the suggested method is generally suitable for the large-scale quantitative assessment of coordination and dynamics in periodic locomotor phenomena.},

In contrast to existing software, it allows the user to follow points of interest with a cursor in the progressing video, without the need to click. To compare the performance of progressive tracking with the conventional frame-wise tracking, we quantified speed and accuracy of both methods, testing two different input devices (mouse and stylus pen). We show that progressive tracking can be twice as fast as frame-wise tracking while maintaining accuracy, given that playback speed is controlled. Using a stylus pen can increase frame-wise tracking speed. The complementary application of the progressive and frame-wise mode is exemplified on a realistic video recording. This study reveals that progressive tracking can vastly facilitate video analysis in experimental research.},

To assess treatment modalities and locomotor recovery in this model, there is an obvious need for detailed characterization of normative overground gait in neurologically intact YMPs. The objective of this study was to assess gait biomechanics and the effect of overground walking speed on gait parameters, kinematics, and electromyographic (EMG) activity in the hindlimb muscles of YMPs. Nine neurologically-intact adult YMPs were trained to walk overground in a straight line. Whole-body kinematics and EMG activity of hindlimb muscles were recorded and analyzed at 6 different speed ranges (0.4-0.59, 0.6-0.79, 0.8-0.99, 1.0-1.19, 1.2-1.39, and 1.4-1.6 m/s). A MATLAB program was developed to detect strides and gait events automatically from motion-captured data. Significant decreases in stride duration, stance and swing times and an increase in stride length were observed with increasing speed. A transition in gait pattern occurred at the 1.0m/s walking speed. Significant increases in the range of motion of the knee and ankle joints were observed at higher speeds. Also, the points of minimum and maximum knee and ankle joint angles occurred earlier in the gait cycle at higher speeds. The onset of EMG activity in the biceps femoris muscle occurred significantly earlier in the gait cycle with increasing speed. A comprehensive characterization of overground walking in neurologically-intact YMPs is provided. These normative measures set the basis against which the effects of future interventions on locomotor capacity in YMPs can be compared.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

    abstract = {The aim of the study was to develop a vitality scoring method, based on piglet behavior and relate it to piglet growth and survival. From 21 sows (Sus scrofa), 287 piglets were used. After farrowing (d 0), piglets were weighed and tested for 4 behavioral parameters in a circular enclosure (55 cm diam.): movement capacity (M), udder stimulation (U), number of completed circles around the enclosure (NCC), and screaming (Sc). Piglets were weighed again on d 1, 2, 3, and 17. Piglet rectal temperature (RT) was recorded on d 0, 1, 2, and 3. Farrowing information of the sow was also recorded. Multiple regression analyses for survival and BW gain at weaning as dependent variables were performed. Piglet BW gain at weaning was influenced by BW at birth (P \\&lt; 0.001), sow parity (P = 0.024), total number of piglets born alive per sow (P \\&lt; 0.001), and sum of U and NCC parameters (UN; P = 0.023). Piglet survival during lactation was influenced by BW at birth (P = 0.015), UNCC parameter (P = 0.026), and RT on d 3 (P = 0.085). The sum of U and NCC parameters, in combination with BW at birth and information of the sow, might be useful to predict piglet growth survival during lactation, thus becoming a useful tool to improve piglet management during the first days of lactation. In conclusion, UNCC parameter seems to be an easy and useful way to assess piglet vitality for both scientific and commercial purposes.},

At a broader level, this paper explores the challenges and opportunities that sensor technologies present in terms of helping animal farmers produce more meat and animal products. More specifically, this paper explores the role of sensors, big data, artificial intelligence and machine learning in helping animal farmers to lower production costs, increase efficiencies, enhance animal welfare and grow more animals per hectare. It also explores the challenges and limitations of technology. The paper reviews various animal farming technology applications to understand its value in helping farmers improve animal health, increase profits and lower environmental footprint.}

Also, the pig, as a large animal model, has become important in biomedical research, especially in preclinical testing of therapeutics. Gait is an essential part of pig movement and its analysis is of great interest, especially when following the phenotype and the effectivity of treatment in pig models for movement and neurological disorders. The aim of this state-of-the-art review is 3-fold: (1) to present and summarize the current instrument base used in pig gait assessment, (2) to point out promising technologies for pig gait analysis, and (3) to outline the suitability of technology for pig gait analysis. The review encompasses 27 studies in total. We included papers published since 2010 and classified them according to which type of measurement instrument was used: 2D camera systems, 3D camera systems, force plates and pressure sensitive mats. In each category we reviewed the data acquisition systems, utilized signals and gait parameters used. An analysis of the literature showed that video-based systems and pressure sensitive mats were the most frequently used. The utilization of 3D camera systems was less common. Force plates were only used occasionally. In conclusion, despite growing interest in using inertial sensor units in movement analysis, they were missing in pig gait analysis. Along with the progress in instrumentation and its ability to produce a huge amount of information, simpler and more user-friendly tools should be developed to provide easy interpretation of the data captured by pig practitioners in the pig industry, or by scientists.},

    abstract = { In this paper we review studies that have identified collective variables (order parameters) in movement coordination, control and skill with emphasis on whole-body multiple joint degree of freedom (DF) tasks. Collective variables of a dynamical system have been proposed formally and informally from a diverse set of perceptual-motor tasks, from which we emphasize: bimanual coordination, locomotion (pedalo, walking, running, bicycle riding), roller ball task, static (quiet standing) and dynamic (moving on a ski-simulator) balance, grasping, and juggling. Several types of candidate collective variables have been identified, including: relative phase, frequency ratio, number of hands active in grasping, synchrony, learning rate and relative timing. There is a strong influence of the task goal in determining the collective variable that can be body or environment relative. The emergence of the task relevant collective variable is typically in the early stage of skill learning where subjects through practice adapt movement organization to realize a never previously produced movement coordination pattern. Throughout, the paper elaborates on open theoretical, experimental and analysis issues for collective variables in the context of task constraints and Bernstein’s (1967) view of skill acquisition as learning to master redundant DF. },

    abstract = {Neuromechanics seeks to understand how muscles, sense organs, motor pattern generators, and brain interact to produce coordinated movement, not only in complex terrain but also when confronted with unexpected perturbations. Applications of neuromechanics include ameliorating human health problems (including prosthesis design and restoration of movement following brain or spinal cord injury), as well as the design, actuation and control of mobile robots. In animals, coordinated movement emerges from the interplay among descending output from the central nervous system, sensory input from body and environment, muscle dynamics, and the emergent dynamics of the whole animal. The inevitable coupling between neural information processing and the emergent mechanical behavior of animals is a central theme of neuromechanics. Fundamentally, motor control involves a series of transformations of information, from brain and spinal cord to muscles to body, and back to brain. The control problem revolves around the specific transfer functions that describe each transformation. The transfer functions depend on the rules of organization and operation that determine the dynamic behavior of each subsystem (i.e., central processing, force generation, emergent dynamics, and sensory processing). In this review, we (1) consider the contributions of muscles, (2) sensory processing, and (3) central networks to motor control, (4) provide examples to illustrate the interplay among brain, muscles, sense organs and the environment in the control of movement, and (5) describe advances in both robotics and neuromechanics that have emerged from application of biological principles in robotic design. Taken together, these studies demonstrate that (1) intrinsic properties of muscle contribute to dynamic stability and control of movement, particularly immediately after perturbations; (2) proprioceptive feedback reinforces these intrinsic self-stabilizing properties of muscle; (3) control systems must contend with inevitable time delays that can simplify or complicate control; and (4) like most animals under a variety of circumstances, some robots use a trial and error process to tune central feedforward control to emergent body dynamics.},

All piglets were individually weighed at birth and at 27 days of age (weaning) but only some of them were studied after weaning. Increasing litter size from ≤11 to ≥16 piglets results in a reduced mean birth weight from 1.59 to 1.26 kg, which corresponds to a mean decrease of 35 g per each additional piglet born. Concomitantly, the proportion of small piglets, i.e. weighing less than 1 kg, increases from 7 to 23\% of total born in these litters. Below 1.0 kg BW, more than 11\% of piglets are stillbirths and thereafter more than 17\% die within the first 24 h. The corresponding values above 1.0 kg average 4 and 3\%, respectively. Despite a low number of small animals still alive at weaning, our data indicate that the higher is the birth weight the higher is the average daily gain both over the sucking, the post-weaning and the growing–finishing periods.},

    abstract = {Low birth weight (LBW) piglets are an increasingly common occurrence on commercial pig farms, due to selection for sow fecundity. In humans, LBW is a known risk factor for impaired brain development, resulting in impaired neurological functioning and increased vulnerability to stressors. In pigs, the pre-weaning effects of LBW on neurological and emotional functioning are less well known. To assess neurological development, 60 LBW and 60 normal birth weight (NBW) piglets were subjected to a neurological examination at day one after birth. To assess fear responses, another 60 LBW-NBW pairs were compared in a human approach test (HAT) at three weeks of age. In the neurological exam, neonatal LBW piglets were found to be less likely to display a withdrawal reflex in response to a painful stimulus (P = 0.022) and showed impaired coordination during locomotion on a balance beam (P  =  0.030). These findings suggest LBW piglets’ increased neonatal mortality, often due to an impaired ability to compete over food or avoid crushing by the sow, could be influenced by a delayed neuromotor development. No effects of birth weight were found on behavioral responses in the HAT, such as latency to approach an unfamiliar human and rate of vocalizations. This suggests LBW and NBW piglets have similar levels of fear in this test. However, we also found indications that the fearfulness displayed by nursing piglets in the HAT is likely due to the temporary removal from the farrowing pen, instead of the presence of an unfamiliar human. Therefore, we can only conclude that LBW does not influence the behavioral response to this combination of stressors (i.e., social isolation from the sow and the piglets’ litter mates, whilst being in a novel environment), as measured by the HAT. Future studies are required to assess whether fear responses to less salient on-farm stressors are affected by birth weight.},

There are many different types of MLSSs and ALSSs. Twenty-five MLSSs were found in 244 articles. MLSSs use different types of scale (ordinal or continuous) and different gait and posture traits need to be observed. The most used MLSS (used in 28\% of the references) is based on asymmetric gait, reluctance to bear weight, and arched back, and is scored on a five-level scale. Fifteen ALSSs were found that could be categorized according to three approaches: (a) the kinetic approach measures forces involved in locomotion, (b) the kinematic approach measures time and distance of variables associated to limb movement and some specific posture variables, and (c) the indirect approach uses behavioural variables or production variables as indicators for impaired locomotion. Agreement and reliability estimates were scarcely reported in articles related to MLSSs. When reported, inappropriate statistical methods such as PABAK and Pearson and Spearman correlation coefficients were commonly used. Some of the most frequently used MLSSs were poorly evaluated for agreement and reliability. Agreement and reliability estimates for the original four-, five- or nine-level MLSS, expressed in percentage of agreement, kappa and weighted kappa, showed large ranges among and sometimes also within articles. After the transformation into a two-level scale, agreement and reliability estimates showed acceptable estimates (percentage of agreement ≥75\%; kappa and weighted kappa ≥0.6), but still estimates showed a large variation between articles. Agreement and reliability estimates for ALSSs were not reported in any article. Several ALSSs use MLSSs as a reference for model calibration and validation. However, varying agreement and reliability estimates of MLSSs make a clear definition of a lameness case difficult, and thus affect the validity of ALSSs. MLSSs and ALSSs showed limited validity for hoof lesion detection and pain assessment. The utilization of MLSSs and ALSSs should aim to the prevention and efficient management of conditions that induce impaired locomotion. Long-term studies comparing MLSSs and ALSSs while applying various strategies to detect and control unfavourable conditions leading to impaired locomotion are required to determine the usefulness of MLSSs and ALSSs for securing optimal production and animal welfare in practice.},

However, it is not clear what the current healthcare applications of single camera markerless motion capture are and what information is being collected that may be used to inform clinical decision making. This review aims to map the available literature to highlight potential use cases and identify the limitations of the technology for clinicians and researchers interested in the collection of movement data. Survey Methodology: Studies were collected up to 14 January 2022 using Pubmed, CINAHL and SPORTDiscus using a systematic search. Data recorded included the description of the markerless system, clinical outcome measures, and biomechanical data mapped to the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health Framework (ICF). Studies were grouped by patient population. Results: A total of 50 studies were included for data collection. Use cases for single camera markerless motion capture technology were identified for Neurological Injury in Children and Adults; Hereditary/Genetic Neuromuscular Disorders; Frailty; and Orthopaedic or Musculoskeletal groups. Single camera markerless systems were found to perform well in studies involving single plane measurements, such as in the analysis of infant general movements or spatiotemporal parameters of gait, when evaluated against 3D marker-based systems and a variety of clinical outcome measures. However, they were less capable than marker-based systems in studies requiring the tracking of detailed 3D kinematics or fine movements such as finger tracking. Conclusions: Single camera markerless motion capture offers great potential for extending the scope of movement analysis outside of laboratory settings in a practical way, but currently suffers from a lack of accuracy where detailed 3D kinematics are required for clinical decision making. Future work should therefore focus on improving tracking accuracy of movements that are out of plane relative to the camera orientation or affected by occlusion, such as supination and pronation of the forearm.}},

The objective of this study was to determine whether there are detectable changes in joint and stride kinematics of clinically sound and unsound pigs, with or without post mortem joint lesions of osteochondrosis. A cohort of 24 pigs underwent five camera-based motion captures, 7–10d apart and between 63kg and 90kg average liveweight, during which 3D coordinate data of reflective skin markers attached to leg anatomical landmarks were collected. Pigs walked on the same solid concrete walkway during captures. Statistical analysis was performed within captures across pigs which were categorised based on a series of deficiency characteristics. Results showed that pigs with clinical deficiencies and degenerative joint lesions had altered kinematics, although there were capture-related fluctuations in the findings. For pigs with conformational and perceived gait abnormalities there were significant differences in joint flexion values and left and right flexion symmetry, mainly reflected in the swing ranges of motion, compared to sound animals. Buck-kneed front legs were found to cause flexion deficiencies during the stance phase of stride cycles (P≤0.05; −9 degrees). Pigs with osteochondral joint lesions had mainly stance-related angular changes (P≤0.05) and asymmetry. Irregularity in the step-to-stride length relationship was elevated in both clinically and subclinically deficient pigs (respectively P=0.06, 1.5 times greater; P≤0.05; 1.5 times greater), but not the healthy pigs. These data provide basic kinematic values for clinically sound and affected pigs which could be used for further research into early and automated detection of leg disorders as well as for improved selection of breeding animals for longevity characteristics.}},

We calculated linear mixed-effects models to assess the influence of sex and running speed on BOG and identify the kinematic and anthropometric variables most associated with BOG.A significant interaction between sex and running speed on BOG was observed, with males demonstrating a smaller BOG than females at faster speeds and BOG decreasing overall with speed. The kinematic measures most associated with BOG at preferred running speed were foot-inclination angle at initial contact and peak stance-phase hip adduction and ankle dorsiflexion. Anterior-superior iliac spine width was the anthropometric variable most associated with BOG at preferred running speed.Sex and running speed must be considered when determining the appropriateness of an individual's BOG.

This raises the question whether coordinated movement patterns and the underlying muscular control in these animals is fully innate or whether there still exists a rapid maturation. We addressed this question by studying gait development in neonatal pigs through the analysis of spatio-temporal gait characteristics during locomotion at self-selected speed. To this end, we made video recordings of piglets walking along a corridor at several time points (from 0 h to 96 h). After digitization of the footfalls, we analysed self-selected speed and spatio-temporal characteristics (e.g. stride and step lengths, stride frequency and duty factor) to study dynamic similarity, intralimb coordination and interlimb coordination. To assess the variability of the gait pattern, left–right asymmetry was studied. To distinguish neuromotor maturation from effects caused by growth, both absolute and normalized data (according to the dynamic similarity concept) were included in the analysis. All normalized spatio-temporal variables reached stable values within 4 h of birth, with most of them showing little change after the age of 2 h. Most asymmetry indices showed stable values, hovering around 10\%, within 8 h of birth. These results indicate that coordinated movement patterns are not entirely innate, but that a rapid neuromotor maturation, potentially also the result of the rearrangement or recombination of existing motor modules, takes place in these precocial animals.},

This intrauterine competition greatly influences postnatal traits such as birth weight and vitality (physical strength). A lowered vitality is most often observed among low birth weight piglets. Since it has been argued that locomotion might be key to unraveling vitality-related differences, we compared gait development in piglets with a low birth weight and low vitality (L piglets) with piglets with a normal birth weight and normal vitality (N piglets) by means of spatio-temporal gait analysis during locomotion at self-selected speed. Video recordings of L and N piglets walking along a corridor at ten time points (between birth and 96 h after birth) were made and the footfalls were digitized. Hence, self-selected speed, spatio-temporal characteristics and gait symmetry were analyzed to compare motor performance, neuromotor maturation (motor task, interlimb and intralimb coordination) and gait variability for L and N piglets. The analysis included both absolute and normalized data (according to the dynamic similarity concept), to distinguish neuromotor maturation from effects caused by growth. Results indicate that intrauterine crowding affects locomotion, mainly by impairing growth in utero, with a lowered motor performance during the first 96 h of age as a consequence. A difference in neuromotor skills was also visible, though only for swing and stance duration, implying a difference in neuromotor development in utero. However, further maturation during the first days after birth does not seem to be affected by intrauterine crowding. We can therefore conclude that L piglets might be considered a smaller and fictitious younger version of N piglets.},

Previously, our group described how IUC affects locomotion during the piglet’s first days of life (until 96 h after birth). We noted a reduced motor performance in piglets with a low birth weight and low vitality (L piglets), compared to piglets with a normal birth weight and normal vitality (N piglets), indicating L piglets are unable to produce enough force. Our current study investigates whether this observed force deficit in L piglets is caused by a reduced force generating capacity in the muscles and/or a lower percentage of type II (fast-contracting) fibers. Volume and fiber length of the main extensor muscles of the hind limb were used to estimate the physiological cross-sectional area (PSCA) and hence calculate the maximal isometric force generating capacity (Fiso-max) of the hind limb. To check for developmental differences between the muscles of L and N piglets, Fiso-max was normalized to body weight (BW), thus yielding a dimensionless variable F’iso-max. To check for differences in muscle composition, m. vastus lateralis was stained immunohistochemically in order to determine the percentage of type II fibers through image analysis. Our results indicate that L piglets have a reduced absolute force generating capacity due to a lesser muscle mass, compared to N piglets. However, when normalized to BW L piglets actually show a larger force generating capacity, suggesting their muscles are more voluminous, given their body mass, than those of N piglets. However, no differences between L and N piglets were detected with regard to muscle composition of the m. vastus lateralis. Based on our data, we can say that neither normalized force generating capacity, nor muscle composition (of the m. vastus lateralis) can explain the observed force deficit in L piglets and as such the effect of IUC on locomotor performance.},

In a previous study, we discovered that piglets with a low birth weight/low vitality (L piglets) have a reduced motor performance compared to piglets with a normal birth weight/normal vitality (N piglets). A possible explanation is that L piglets lack the energy to increase their motor performance to the level of that of N piglets. Blood glucose levels (GLU) and glycogen concentrations in skeletal muscle of the front (GLYFRONT) and hind leg (GLYHIND) and the liver (GLYLIVER) at birth and during the first 96 h postpartum were compared between L and N piglets. GLU at birth was the same for both groups. After birth, GLU immediately increased in N piglets, whereas it only increased after 8 h in L piglets. L piglets showed a lower GLYHIND at birth and did not use this glycogen during the first 8 h postpartum, while N piglets showed a gradual depletion. GLYLIVER at birth was 50\% lower for L piglets and was unused during the studied period while N piglets consumed half of their GLYLIVER during the first 8 h. Based on these results, it is possible that lower glycogen concentrations at birth, the delayed increase in GLU and the lower use of glycogen during the first 8 h after birth negatively affect motor performance in L piglets. However, based on this study, it is unclear whether the low mobilization of glycogen by L piglets is a consequence, rather than a cause of their lower motor performance.},

Advancing postnatal age, not only post-conceptional age, may determine neuromuscular development, and early interventions in preterm newborns may improve their later motor skills. An animal model of preterm birth that allows early postnatal detection of movement patterns may help to investigate this hypothesis.Methods: Using pigs as a model for moderately preterm infants, preterm (106-day gestation, equivalent to 90\% of normal gestation time; n = 38) and term (115-day gestation, equivalent to 99\% of normal gestation time; n = 20) individuals were delivered by cesarean section and artificially reared until postnatal day 19 (preweaning period). The neuromotor skills of piglets were documented using spatiotemporal gait analyses on video recordings of locomotion at self-selected speed at postnatal age 3, 4, 5, 8, and 18 days. Results were controlled for effects of body weight and sex.Results: Both preterm and term piglets reached mature neuromotor skills and performance between postnatal days 3–5. However, preterm pigs took shorter steps at a higher frequency, than term piglets, irrespective of their body size. Within preterm pigs, males and low birth weight individuals took the shortest steps, and with the highest frequency.Conclusion: Postnatal development of motor skills and gait characteristics in pigs delivered in late gestation may show similarity to the compromised development of gait pattern in preterm infants. Relative to term pigs, the postnatal delay in gait development in preterm pigs was only few days, that is, much shorter than the 10-day reduction in gestation length. This indicates rapid postnatal adaptation of gait pattern after reduced gestational age at birth. Early-life physical training and medical interventions may support both short- and long-term gait development after preterm birth in both pigs and infants.},

    abstract = {{Abstract Intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) is frequently observed in pig production, especially when using highly prolific sows. IUGR piglets are born with low body weight and shape indicative of differences in organ growth. Insufficient uteroplacental nutrient transfer to the fetuses is the leading cause of growth restriction in the pig. Supplementing the sow's gestation diet with arginine and/or glutamine improves placenta growth and functionality and consequently is able to reduce IUGR incidence. IUGR piglets are at higher risk of dying preweaning and face higher morbidity than their normal-weight littermates. A high level of surveillance during farrowing and individual nutrient supplementation can reduce the mortality rates. Still, these do not reverse the long-term consequences of IUGR, which are induced by persistent structural deficits in different organs. Dietary interventions peri-weaning can optimize performance but these are less effective in combating the metabolic changes that occurred in IUGR, which affect reproductive performance later in life. IUGR piglets share many similarities with IUGR infants, such as a poorer outcome of males. Using the IUGR piglet as an animal model to further explore the structural and molecular basis of the long-term consequences of IUGR and the potential sex bias could aid in fully understanding the impact of prenatal undernutrition and finding solutions for both species and sexes.}},

Management strategies such as co-mingling of non-littermates before weaning aim to mimic (semi)natural conditions and to stimulate social skills in piglets in order to minimize the adverse effects of stress around weaning. The present study investigated in which way timing of co-mingling non-littermate piglets during lactation in conventional farrowing units had implications for the sow and affected the performance and behaviour of piglets before and after weaning. In the experimental treatments, 3 litters were co-mingled either at day 16 before weaning (n  =  27 sows and their litters), day 11 before weaning (n  =  27) or day 6 before weaning (n  =  27). In the control treatment, piglets were not grouped before weaning (n  =  27). In total, 1294 piglets were weaned at 21 days of age. At weaning, piglets from 3 litters within each treatment were mixed. Piglets from the co-mingling system were housed with those they were co-mingled with during lactation, whereas control piglets were mixed with unfamiliar piglets. Co-mingling of non-littermate piglets did not affect sow body condition and lesion scores of udder and teats during lactation. Piglets co-mingled 6 days before weaning tended to gain less weight during d-6 – d-1 before weaning (P  =  0.082), but piglet growth was not affected during d-16 – d-1. After weaning, the feed to gain ratio in piglets which were co-mingled 6 days before weaning tended to be lowest during the first week after weaning (P  =  0.086), but no other treatment effects were observed in the post-weaning phase. Skin lesion score of the shoulders and flanks tended to be higher at day 11 before weaning in piglets co-mingled 16 days before weaning (P  =  0.051) and was highest at day 6 before weaning in piglets co-mingled 11 days before weaning (P < 0.001). However, 1 day before weaning no differences in skin lesions were observed. After weaning, the socialized piglets had less skin lesions at the shoulders and flanks compared to control piglets (P < 0.001). In conclusion, pre-weaning co-mingling of non-littermates resulted in less aggression (i.e. lesions) at weaning, suggesting better social skills and a reduction of stress, consistent with a tendency for improved feed to gain ratio in the first week after weaning. Time of co-mingling seemed not crucial.},

    abstract = {The increase in litter sizes in recent years has resulted in more low birth weight (LBW) piglets, accompanied by a higher mortality. A potential intervention to overcome this is drenching bioactive substances. However, if the act of drenching provokes additional stress in LBW piglets, it might counteract the supplement’s effect and be detrimental for the piglet’s survival. To study the effect of the drenching act, piglets from 67 sows were weighed within 4 h after birth. The mean litter birth weight (MLBW) and standard deviation (SD) were calculated. LBW piglets (n = 76) were defined as weighing between (MLBW-1*SD) and (MLBW-2.5*SD). They were randomly allocated to two treatments: “sham” (conducting the act of drenching by inserting an empty 2.5 mL syringe in the mouth during 20 s, once a day, d1 till d7; n = 37) or “no treatment” (no handling; n = 39). On day 1, 3, 9, 24 and 38, piglets were weighed and scored for skin lesions. Blood samples were collected on day 9 and 38 and analyzed to determine glucose, non-esterified fatty acids (NEFA), urea, immunoglobulin G (IgG), insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) and a standard blood panel test. There was no difference between sham drenched and untreated piglets regarding any of the parameters. In conclusion, this study showed that drenching does not impose a significant risk to LBW piglets and can be applied safely during the first 7 days after birth.},

    abstract = {Inadequate floor properties are considered the primary cause of the majority of claw disorders in pigs but to date no clear relationship has been found between claw disorders and floor properties such as friction and surface abrasiveness. To determine this relationship, the factors controlling pig gait must be characterised. This study examined unprovoked pig gait on a concrete floor in clean conditions and compared it with gait in fouled floor conditions. Kinematics were used to record gait parameters such as walking speed, stride length, swing and stance time, stride elevation together with limb support phases, gait symmetry, diagonality and duty factor. On clean floors, pigs had an unprovoked symmetrical gait with alternating two- and three-beat support phases and a high rate of diagonality. Stride length, swing and stance time and stride elevation showed little variation. Pigs altered their gait in accordance with floor conditions to maintain gait control by reducing walking speed, lowering diagonality and employing more three-limb support phases. Pigs also shortened their stride length and prolonged their stance time.},

Forty-four Landrace×Yorkshire gilts were randomly assigned to receive one of four dietary energy allowances (n = 11): low (L), medium (M), high (H), and extremely high (EH). The gilts in L, M, H, and EH treatments were provided 75, 100, 125, and 150\% of the energy requirement for maintenance from 0 to 30 d of gestation, respectively. Compared to d 0–30 of gestation, dietary energy allowances in each group increased by 20\% from d 30–90 of gestation and increased by 50\% from d 90 of gestation to parturition. After parturition, all primiparous sows received the same diet and fed ad libitum during lactation. The results showed that dietary energy linearly and quadratically increased (P<0.01) sow body weight and backfat thickness at d 0 and 28 of lactation. Dietary energy linearly and quadratically increased (P<0.01) sow body weight gain and backfat gain from d 0 of gestation to d 0 of lactation. With increasing dietary energy allowance, there were linear and quadratic increases (P<0.01) in sow body weight loss and backfat loss during lactation, and linear and quadratic decreases (P<0.01) in average daily feed intake during lactation. However, with increasing dietary energy allowance, individual birth and weaning weight linearly and quadratically increased (P<0.05), and litter weight quadratically increased at birth (P<0.05) and tended to increase at weaning (quadratic, P = 0.06). The greatest litter weight at birth and weaning was observed when sows were provided the H energy allowance. The number of total born and born alive was not influenced by dietary energy. With increasing dietary energy allowance, the fat and protein content linearly and quadratically increased (P<0.01) in colostrum, and the fat and protein content quadratically increased (P = 0.01) in mature milk. The greatest fat and protein content in mature milk was observed when sows were provided the H energy allowance. The results indicated that providing 125, 150, and 187.5\% of the energy requirement for maintenance during early, mid, and late gestation was beneficial in maintaining optimal body condition of primiparous sows, as well as improving piglet growth performance and milk fat and protein output.},

It considers the technological principles upon which PLF is based, gives several examples of PLF, considers which livestock processes are suitable for the PLF approach, addresses whether PLF constitutes technology push or market pull, and stresses the need for a prospective bioethical analysis of PLF. We conclude that PLF is an embryonic technology with great promise but one that requires considerable research and development before uptake.}

    abstract  = {To describe and help interpret joint movements in various forms of primate locomotion, we explored the use of Fourier analysis to represent changing joint angles as a series of sine and cosine curves added together to approximate the raw angular data. Results are presented for four joints (shoulder, elbow, hip and knee) with emphasis on the shoulder, and for five types of locomotion (catarhine primate quadrupedal walking, human hands-and-feet creeping and hands-and-knees creeping, and human walking and running). Fourier analysis facilitates functional interpretation of the angles of all four joints, by providing average joint angles and an indication of the number of peaks and troughs in the angular data. The description of limb movements also afforded us the opportunity to compare human and other catarhine joint angles, and we interpret the Fourier results in terms of locomotor posture and type. In addition, the shoulder data are useful for determination of some aspects of interlimb coordination. Non-human primates walking quadrupedally and humans creeping on hands and knees generally evince diagonal couplets interlimb coordination, in which the hand on one side strikes the substrate at about the same time as the contralateral foot or knee. Furthermore, human walking and running seem to follow a similar pattern, as indicated by Fourier analysis. From our data it is concluded that human bipedal gaits are qualitatively similar to diagonal couplets gaits in other primates, but quite different from the lateral couplets gaits used by many non-primate mammals. A number of other benefits of Fourier analysis in primate locomotion studies are also discussed. These include the ability to make statistical comparisons among various types of limb movements in a wide variety of species, a simple archival technique for limb movement data, and a greater understanding of the variability of locomotor movements.},

    abstract = {Large-scale phenotyping of animal behaviour traits is time consuming and has led to increased demand for technologies that can automate these procedures. Automated tracking of animals has been successful in controlled laboratory settings, but recording from animals in large groups in highly variable farm settings presents challenges. The aim of this review is to provide a systematic overview of the advances that have occurred in automated, high throughput image detection of farm animal behavioural traits with welfare and production implications. Peer-reviewed publications written in English were reviewed systematically following Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. After identification, screening, and assessment for eligibility, 108 publications met these specifications and were included for qualitative synthesis. Data collected from the papers included camera specifications, housing conditions, group size, algorithm details, procedures, and results. Most studies utilized standard digital colour video cameras for data collection, with increasing use of 3D cameras in papers published after 2013. Papers including pigs (across production stages) were the most common (n = 63). The most common behaviours recorded included activity level, area occupancy, aggression, gait scores, resource use, and posture. Our review revealed many overlaps in methods applied to analysing behaviour, and most studies started from scratch instead of building upon previous work. Training and validation sample sizes were generally small (mean±s.d. groups = 3.8±5.8) and in data collection and testing took place in relatively controlled environments. To advance our ability to automatically phenotype behaviour, future research should build upon existing knowledge and validate technology under commercial settings and publications should explicitly describe recording conditions in detail to allow studies to be reproduced.},

    abstract = {Abstract The importance of locomotion to evolutionary fitness has led to extensive study of primate locomotor behavior, morphology and ecology. Most previous research has focused on adult primates, but in the last few decades, increased attention to locomotor development has provided new insights toward our broader understanding of primate adaptation and evolution. Here, we review the contributions of this body of work from three basic perspectives. First, we assess possible determinants on the timing of locomotor independence, an important life history event. Significant influences on timing of locomotor independence include adult female body mass, age at weaning, and especially relative brain size, a significant predictor of other primate life history variables. Additionally, we found significant phylogenetic differences in the timing of locomotor independence, even accounting for these influences. Second, we discuss how structural aspects of primate growth may enhance the locomotor performance and safety of young primates, despite their inherent neuromotor and musculoskeletal limitations. For example, compared to adults, growing primates have greater muscle mechanical advantage, greater bone robusticity, and larger extremities with relatively long digits. Third, focusing on primate quadrupedalism, we provide examples that illustrate how ontogenetic transitions in morphology and locomotion can serve as a model system for testing broader principles underlying primate locomotor biomechanics. This approach has led to a better understanding of the key features that contribute to primates’ stride characteristics, gait patterns, limb force distribution, and limb postures. We have learned a great deal from the study of locomotor ontogeny, but there is much left to explore. We conclude by offering guidelines for future research, both in the laboratory and the field.},
