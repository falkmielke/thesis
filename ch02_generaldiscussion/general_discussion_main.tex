\section{What Happened to the General Intro?}

Instead, our attempts must be to \textbf{falsify the hypothesis that there are differences in piglet locomotion}.


But different weight might go in hand with different physical constraints, and one has to account for the trivial consequences of a different physical appearance \citep{Aerts2023}. \#TODO



As I will briefly summarize below, common methods of studying locomotion fall short in their falsification capacity.
First, some methods loose information in processing.
Second, methods might have trouble handling variation.
Third, the matter is complex: just for kinematics, there are subject characteristics (age, sex, \ldots{}), spatiotemporal gait variables (speed, duty factor, clearance, \ldots{}), dynamic posture and effective range of motion, and finally coordination.
Fourth, if we measure, we must keep track measurement uncertainty.


Yet whether or not domestic piglets are a good model species, specifically for human locomotor development, is up for debate.
