    abstract = {{Here, we review the modern interface of three-dimensional (3D) empirical (e.g. motion capture) and theoretical (e.g. modelling and simulation) approaches to the study of terrestrial locomotion using appendages in tetrapod vertebrates. These tools span a spectrum from more empirical approaches such as XROMM, to potentially more intermediate approaches such as finite element analysis, to more theoretical approaches such as dynamic musculoskeletal simulations or conceptual models. These methods have much in common beyond the importance of 3D digital technologies, and are powerfully synergistic when integrated, opening a wide range of hypotheses that can be tested. We discuss the pitfalls and challenges of these 3D methods, leading to consideration of the problems and potential in their current and future usage. The tools (hardware and software) and approaches (e.g. methods for using hardware and software) in the 3D analysis of tetrapod locomotion have matured to the point where now we can use this integration to answer questions we could never have tackled 20 years ago, and apply insights gleaned from them to other fields.}},

The aims of this study were to develop Bayesian models to calculate BV that (a) are robust to “noisy data,” (b) allow heterogeneity in the within-participant CVs, and (c) take advantage of prior knowledge.We explored Bayesian models with different degrees of robustness using adaptive Student t distributions instead of the normal distributions and when the possibility of heterogeneity of the within-participant CV was allowed. Results were compared to more standard approaches using chloride and triglyceride data from the European Biological Variation Study.Using the most robust Bayesian approach on a raw data set gave results comparable to a standard approach with outlier assessments and removal. The posterior distribution of the fitted model gives access to credible intervals for all parameters that can be used to assess reliability. Reliable and relevant priors proved valuable for prediction.The recommended Bayesian approach gives a clear picture of the degree of heterogeneity, and the ability to crudely estimate personal within-participant CVs can be used to explore relevant subgroups. Because BV experiments are expensive and time-consuming, prior knowledge and estimates should be considered of high value and applied accordingly. By including reliable prior knowledge, precise estimates are possible even with small data sets.},

This research is not concerned with whether the brain is a quantum computer. Instead, it uses quantum theory as a fresh conceptual framework and a coherent set of formal tools for explaining puzzling empirical findings in psychology. In this introduction, we focus on two quantum principles as examples to show why quantum cognition is an appealing new theoretical direction for psychology: complementarity, which suggests that some psychological measures have to be made sequentially and that the context generated by the first measure can influence responses to the next one, producing measurement order effects, and superposition, which suggests that some psychological states cannot be defined with respect to definite values but, instead, that all possible values within the superposition have some potential for being expressed. We present evidence showing how these two principles work together to provide a coherent explanation for many divergent and puzzling phenomena in psychology. },

    abstract = {This research essay highlights the need to integrate predictive analytics into information systems research and shows several concrete ways in which this goal can be accomplished. Predictive analytics include empirical methods (statistical and other) that generate data predictions as well as methods for assessing predictive power. Predictive analytics not only assist in creating practically useful models, they also play an important role alongside explanatory modeling in theory building and theory testing. We describe six roles for predictive analytics: new theory generation, measurement development, comparison of competing theories, improvement of existing models, relevance assessment, and assessment of the predictability of empirical phenomena. Despite the importance of predictive analytics, we find that they are rare in the empirical IS literature. Extant IS literature relies nearly exclusively on explanatory statistical modeling, where statistical inference is used to test and evaluate the explanatory power of underlying causal models, and predictive power is assumed to follow automatically from the explanatory model. However, explanatory power does not imply predictive power and thus predictive analytics are necessary for assessing predictive power and for building empirical models that predict well. To show that predictive analytics and explanatory statistical modeling are fundamentally disparate, we show that they are different in each step of the modeling process. These differences translate into different final models, so that a pure explanatory statistical model is best tuned for testing causal hypotheses and a pure predictive model is best in terms of predictive power. We convert a well-known explanatory paper on TAM to a predictive context to illustrate these differences and show how predictive analytics can add theoretical and practical value to IS research.},

In humans, children improve their walking skills through developmental processes and learning experience. In nonhuman primates, infants do not routinely experience bipedalism and their musculoskeletal system gradually specializes for other locomotor modes. The aim of this study is to explore the development of occasional bipedal walking in olive baboon and to test whether the postural adjustments change with age. Materials and Methods We collected kinematics and spatiotemporal parameters of bipedal gait in an ontogenetic sample of 24 baboons. Data were collected at the primatology station of the CNRS (France) and a total of 47 bipedal strides were extracted for the present analysis. Results Adults and adolescents walk bipedally in the same way, and the average kinematic pattern is similar across the age-classes. Infants walk bipedally with longer duty factor, they present larger movement amplitude of the thigh and the amplitude of the knee joint decreases with speed. In contrast, older baboons increase the amplitude of the knee and ankle joints with speed. Discussion In a non-adapted biped, the postural adjustments of bipedal walking vary with age. In infant baboons, the balance requirements are likely to be higher and these are solved by adopting a “blocking strategy”. In older baboons, the postural adjustments are focused on the lower limb and the movements increase with speed. These results may echo, in some respects, the developmental sequence of the intersegmental coordination described in the ontogeny of human locomotion.}

    abstract = {Speed regulation in animals involves stride frequency and stride length. While the relationship between these variables has been well documented, it remains unresolved whether animals primarily modify stride frequency or stride length to increase speed. In this study, we explored the interrelationships between these three variables across a sample of 103 tetrapods and assessed whether speed regulation strategy is influenced by mechanical, allometric, phylogenetic or ecological factors. We observed that crouched terrestrial species tend to regulate speed through stride frequency. Such a strategy is energetically costly, but results in greater locomotor maneuverability and greater stability. In contrast, regulating speed through stride length is closely tied to larger arboreal animals with relatively extended limbs. Such movements reduce substrate oscillations on thin arboreal supports and/or helps to reduce swing phase costs. The slope of speed on frequency is lower in small crouched animals than in large-bodied erect species. As a result, substantially more rapid limb movements are matched with only small speed increases in crouched, small-bodied animals. Furthermore, the slope of speed on stride length was inversely proportional to body mass. As such, small changes in stride length can result in relatively rapid speed increases for small-bodied species. These results are somewhat counterintuitive, in that larger species, which have longer limbs and take longer strides, do not appear to gain as much speed increase out of lengthening their stride. Conversely, smaller species that cycle their limbs rapidly do not gain as much speed out of increasing stride frequency as do larger species.},

    abstract = {Many animals frequently transition between different media while navigating their heterogeneous environments. These media vary in compliance, moisture content, and other characteristics that affect their physical properties. As a result, animals may need to alter their kinematics to adapt to potential changes in media while maintaining performance during predator escape and foraging. Due to its fluid nature, water is highly compliant, and although usually associated with swimming, water running has evolved in a variety of animals ranging from insects to mammals. While the best studied large water runners are the bipedal basilisk lizards (Basiliscus spp.), other lizards have also been observed to run across the surface of water, namely, Hemidactylus platyurus, a house gecko, and in this study, Anolis sagrei, the brown anole. Unlike the basilisk lizard, the primarily arboreal Anolis sagrei is not adapted for water running. Moreover, water running in A. sagrei, similar to that of the house gecko, was primarily quadrupedal. Here, we tested for performance and kinematic differences between aquatic and terrestrial running and if the variance in performance and kinematic variables differed between the two media. We found no difference in average and maximum velocity between running on land and water. We also found that Anolis sagrei had higher hindlimb stride frequencies, decreased duty factor, and shorter stride lengths on water, as well as more erect postures. Finally, we found that most kinematics did not differ in variance between the two media, but of those that were different, almost all were more variable during terrestrial running. Our findings show that animals may be capable of specialized modes of locomotion, even if they are not obviously adapted for them, and that they may do this by modulating their kinematics to facilitate locomotion through novel environments.},

    abstract = {For centuries, elephant locomotion has been a contentious and confusing challenge for locomotion scientists to understand, not only because of technical difficulties but also because elephant locomotion is in some ways atypical of more familiar quadrupedal gaits. We analyzed the locomotor kinematics of over 2400 strides from 14 African and 48 Asian elephant individuals (body mass 116-4632 kg) freely moving over ground at a 17-fold range of speeds, from slow walking at 0.40 m s-1 to the fastest reliably recorded speed for elephants, 6.8 m s-1. These data reveal that African and Asian elephants have some subtle differences in how size-independent kinematic parameters change with speed. Although elephants use a lateral sequence footfall pattern, like many other quadrupeds, they maintain this footfall pattern at all speeds, shifting toward a 25\% phase offset between limbs (singlefoot) as they increase speed. The duty factors of elephants are greater for the forelimbs than for the hindlimbs, so an aerial phase for the hindquarters is reached at slower speeds than for the forequarters. This aerial phase occurs at a Froude number of around 1,matching theoretical predictions. At faster speeds, stance and swing phase durations approach asymptotes, with the duty factor beginning to level off,concurrent with an increase in limb compliance that likely keeps peak forces relatively low. This increase of limb compliance is reflected by increased compression of the hindlimbs. Like other tetrapods, smaller elephants are relatively more athletic than larger ones, but still move very similarly to adults even at \\&lt;500 kg. At any particular speed they adopt greater relative stride frequencies and relative stride lengths compared to larger elephants. This extends to near-maximal locomotor performance as well - smaller elephants reach greater Froude numbers and smaller duty factors, hence likely reach relatively greater peak loads on their limbs and produce this force more rapidly. A variety of lines of kinematic evidence support the inference that elephants change their mechanics near a Froude number of 1 (if not at slower speeds), at least to using more compliant limbs, if not spring-like whole-body kinetics. In some ways, elephants move similarly to many other quadrupeds,such as increasing speed mainly by increasing stride frequency (except at fast speeds), and they match scaling predictions for many stride parameters. The main difference from most other animals is that elephants never change their footfall pattern to a gait that uses a whole-body aerial phase. Our large dataset establishes what the normal kinematics of elephant locomotion are, and can also be applied to identify gait abnormalities that may signal musculoskeletal pathologies, a matter of great importance to keepers of captive elephants.},

    abstract = {During locomotion, mammalian limb postures are influenced by many factors including the animal's limb length and body mass. Polk (2002) compared the gait of similar-sized cercopithecine monkeys that differed limb proportions and found that longer-limbed monkeys usually adopt more extended joint postures than shorter-limbed monkeys in order to moderate their joint moments. Studies of primates as well as non-primate mammals that vary in body mass have demonstrated that larger animals use more extended limb postures than smaller animals. Such extended postures in larger animals increase the extensor muscle mechanical advantage and allow postures to be maintained with relatively less muscular effort (Polk, 2002; Biewener 1989). The results of these previous studies are used here to address two anthropological questions. The first concerns the postural effects of body mass and limb proportion differences between australopithecines and members of the genus Homo. That is, H. erectus and later hominins all have larger body mass and longer legs than australopithecines, and these anatomical differences suggest that Homo probably used more extended postures and probably required relatively less muscular force to resist gravity than the smaller and shorter-limbed australopithecines. The second question investigates how animals with similar size but different limb proportions differ in locomotor performance. The effects of limb proportions on gait are relevant to inferring postural and locomotor differences between Neanderthals and modern Homo sapiens which differ in their crural indices and relative limb length. This study demonstrates that primates with relatively long limbs achieve higher walking speeds while using lower stride frequencies and lower angular excursions than shorter-limbed monkeys, and these kinematic differences may allow longer-limbed taxa to locomote more efficiently than shorter-limbed species of similar mass. Such differences may also have characterized the gait of Homo sapiens in comparison to Neanderthals, but more experimental data on humans that vary in limb proportions are necessary in order to evaluate this question more thoroughly.},

We start with the challenging issue of defining hominin locomotor grades that are currently used liberally and offer our own working definitions of facultative, habitual, and obligate bipedalism. We then discuss the nature of the Pan-Homo last common ancestor and characterize the locomotor adaptation of Sahelanthropus, Orrorin, and Ardipithecus—often referred to as facultative bipeds—and examine the debates on the extent of bipedality and arboreality in these taxa. Moreover, the question of Middle Pliocene hominin locomotor diversity is addressed based on information derived from the ‘Little Foot’ specimen from Sterkfontein, footprints from Laetoli, and the Burtele Foot in Ethiopia. Our review suggests that the most convincing evidence for locomotor diversity comes from Burtele, whereas the evidence from Sterkfontein and Laetoli is unconvincing and equivocal, respectively. Finally, we address the decades old issue of the significance of arboreality in the otherwise habitual biped, Australopithecus, with emphasis on Australopithecus afarensis and its implications for the paleobiology of these creatures. We conclude that many of the apelike features encountered, mostly in the upper part of the Australopithecus skeleton, were retained for their significance in climbing. Approaches that have investigated character plasticity and those exploring internal bone structure have shown that the shoulder and limbs in Au. afarensis and Australopithecus africanus were involved in arboreal activities that are thought to be key for feeding, nesting, and predator avoidance. We conclude that many of the so-called retained ape-like features persisted due to stabilizing selection, that early hominins engaged in a considerable amount of arboreality even after Australopithecus had become a habitual biped, and arboreality only ceased to be an important component of hominin locomotor behavior after the emergence of Homo erectus.},

Hunt proposed a model for understanding the potential selective pressures on hominins, made robust, testable predictions based on Au. afarensis functional morphology, and presented a hypothesis that aimed to explain the dual functional signals of the Au. afarensis and, more generally, early hominin postcranium. Here we synthesize what we have learned about Au. afarensis functional morphology and the dual functional signals of two new australopith discoveries with relatively complete skeletons (Australopithecus sediba and StW 573 ‘Australopithecus prometheus’). We follow this with a discussion of three research approaches that have been developed for the purpose of drawing behavioral inferences in early hominins: (1) developments in the study of extant apes as models for understanding hominin origins; (2) novel and continued developments to quantify bipedal gait and locomotor economy in extant primates to infer the locomotor costs from the anatomy of fossil taxa; and (3) novel developments in the study of internal bone structure to extract functional signals from fossil remains. In conclusion of this review, we discuss some of the inherent challenges of the approaches and methodologies adopted to reconstruct the locomotor modes and behavioral repertoires in extinct primate taxa, and notably the assessment of habitual terrestrial bipedalism in early hominins.},

Results are presented for four joints (shoulder, elbow, hip and knee) with emphasis on the shoulder, and for five types of locomotion (catarhine primate quadrupedal walking, human hands-and-feet creeping and hands-and-knees creeping, and human walking and running). Fourier analysis facilitates functional interpretation of the angles of all four joints, by providing average joint angles and an indication of the number of peaks and troughs in the angular data. The description of limb movements also afforded us the opportunity to compare human and other catarhine joint angles, and we interpret the Fourier results in terms of locomotor posture and type. In addition, the shoulder data are useful for determination of some aspects of interlimb coordination. Non-human primates walking quadrupedally and humans creeping on hands and knees generally evince diagonal couplets interlimb coordination, in which the hand on one side strikes the substrate at about the same time as the contralateral foot or knee. Furthermore, human walking and running seem to follow a similar pattern, as indicated by Fourier analysis. From our data it is concluded that human bipedal gaits are qualitatively similar to diagonal couplets gaits in other primates, but quite different from the lateral couplets gaits used by many non-primate mammals. A number of other benefits of Fourier analysis in primate locomotion studies are also discussed. These include the ability to make statistical comparisons among various types of limb movements in a wide variety of species, a simple archival technique for limb movement data, and a greater understanding of the variability of locomotor movements.},

    abstract = {Locomotion is one of the most important ecological functions in animals. Precocial animals, such as pigs, are capable of independent locomotion shortly after birth. This raises the question whether coordinated movement patterns and the underlying muscular control in these animals is fully innate or whether there still exists a rapid maturation. We addressed this question by studying gait development in neonatal pigs through the analysis of spatio-temporal gait characteristics during locomotion at self-selected speed. To this end, we made video recordings of piglets walking along a corridor at several time points (from 0 h to 96 h). After digitization of the footfalls, we analysed self-selected speed and spatio-temporal characteristics (e.g. stride and step lengths, stride frequency and duty factor) to study dynamic similarity, intralimb coordination and interlimb coordination. To assess the variability of the gait pattern, left–right asymmetry was studied. To distinguish neuromotor maturation from effects caused by growth, both absolute and normalized data (according to the dynamic similarity concept) were included in the analysis. All normalized spatio-temporal variables reached stable values within 4 h of birth, with most of them showing little change after the age of 2 h. Most asymmetry indices showed stable values, hovering around 10\%, within 8 h of birth. These results indicate that coordinated movement patterns are not entirely innate, but that a rapid neuromotor maturation, potentially also the result of the rearrangement or recombination of existing motor modules, takes place in these precocial animals.},

    abstract = {Abstract X-Ray Reconstruction of Moving Morphology (XROMM) comprises a set of 3D X-ray motion analysis techniques that merge motion data from in vivo X-ray videos with skeletal morphology data from bone scans into precise and accurate animations of 3D bones moving in 3D space. XROMM methods include: (1) manual alignment (registration) of bone models to video sequences, i.e., Scientific Rotoscoping; (2) computer vision-based autoregistration of bone models to biplanar X-ray videos; and (3) marker-based registration of bone models to biplanar X-ray videos. Here, we describe a novel set of X-ray hardware, software, and workflows for marker-based XROMM. Refurbished C-arm fluoroscopes retrofitted with high-speed video cameras offer a relatively inexpensive X-ray hardware solution for comparative biomechanics research. Precision for our biplanar C-arm hardware and analysis software, measured as the standard deviation of pairwise distances between 1 mm tantalum markers embedded in rigid objects, was found to be ±0.046 mm under optimal conditions and ±0.084 mm under actual in vivo recording conditions. Mean error in measurement of a known distance between two beads was within the 0.01 mm fabrication tolerance of the test object, and mean absolute error was 0.037 mm. Animating 3D bone models from sets of marker positions (XROMM animation) makes it possible to study skeletal kinematics in the context of detailed bone morphology. The biplanar fluoroscopy hardware and computational methods described here should make XROMM an accessible and useful addition to the available technologies for studying the form, function, and evolution of vertebrate animals.

In a previous study, we discovered that piglets with a low birth weight/low vitality (L piglets) have a reduced motor performance compared to piglets with a normal birth weight/normal vitality (N piglets). A possible explanation is that L piglets lack the energy to increase their motor performance to the level of that of N piglets. Blood glucose levels (GLU) and glycogen concentrations in skeletal muscle of the front (GLYFRONT) and hind leg (GLYHIND) and the liver (GLYLIVER) at birth and during the first 96 h postpartum were compared between L and N piglets. GLU at birth was the same for both groups. After birth, GLU immediately increased in N piglets, whereas it only increased after 8 h in L piglets. L piglets showed a lower GLYHIND at birth and did not use this glycogen during the first 8 h postpartum, while N piglets showed a gradual depletion. GLYLIVER at birth was 50\% lower for L piglets and was unused during the studied period while N piglets consumed half of their GLYLIVER during the first 8 h. Based on these results, it is possible that lower glycogen concentrations at birth, the delayed increase in GLU and the lower use of glycogen during the first 8 h after birth negatively affect motor performance in L piglets. However, based on this study, it is unclear whether the low mobilization of glycogen by L piglets is a consequence, rather than a cause of their lower motor performance.},

    abstract = {Despite great advances in mechanical ventilation and surfactant administration for the newborn infant with life-threatening respiratory failure no specific therapies are currently established to tackle major pro-inflammatory pathways. The susceptibility of the newborn infant with neonatal acute respiratory distress syndrome (NARDS) to exogenous surfactant is linked with a suppression of most of the immunologic responses by the innate immune system, however, additional corticosteroids applied in any severe pediatric lung disease with inflammatory background do not reduce morbidity or mortality and may even cause harm. Thus, the neonatal piglet model of acute lung injury serves as an excellent model to study respiratory failure and is the preferred animal model for reasons of availability, body size, similarities of porcine and human lung, robustness, and costs. In addition, similarities to the human toll-like receptor 4, the existence of intraalveolar macrophages, the sensitivity to lipopolysaccharide, and the production of nitric oxide make the piglet indispensable in anti-inflammatory research. Here we present the physiologic and immunologic data of newborn piglets from three trials involving acute lung injury secondary to repeated airway lavage (and others), mechanical ventilation, and a specific anti-inflammatory intervention via the intratracheal route using surfactant as a carrier substance. The physiologic data from many organ systems of the newborn piglet—but with preference on the lung—are presented here differentiating between baseline data from the uninjured piglet, the impact of acute lung injury on various parameters (24 h), and the follow up data after 72 h of mechanical ventilation. Data from the control group and the intervention groups are listed separately or combined. A systematic review of the newborn piglet meconium aspiration model and the repeated airway lavage model is finally presented. While many studies assessed lung injury scores, leukocyte infiltration, and protein/cytokine concentrations in bronchoalveolar fluid, a systematic approach to tackle major upstream pro-inflammatory pathways of the innate immune system is still in the fledgling stages. For the sake of newborn infants with life-threatening NARDS the newborn piglet model still is an unsettled promise offering many options to conquer neonatal physiology/immunology and to establish potent treatment modalities.},

Three air temperature ranges, described as thermoneutral (32-38 °C), moderate (18-26 °C) and cold (0-10 °C) and representing the usual birth environments of infants, piglets and lambs, respectively, have been considered. The analysis revealed the following noteworthy points. Carbohydrate and lipid are the major energy substrates for heat production because protein catabolism is minimal during the first day after birth in all three species. The availability of carbohydrate determines how long the new-born can avoid hypoglycaemia, which threatens well being because it leads to hypothermia or compromised cerebral function, but lipid availability can affect the periods for which the carbohydrate can last. Thus, in unfed piglets and lambs the available reserves of liver and skeletal muscle glycogen (g/kg body weight) are similar in normal (n.) and growth retarded (g.r.) individuals, but glycogen exhaustion occurs earlier in g.r. new-borns because a reduced lipid availability in them increases their dependence on carbohydrate. In contrast, lipid energy is plentiful in g.r., preterm (p.) and n. infants, so that the faster depletion of glycogen in g.r./p. than in n. individuals is primarily due to a restricted prenatal glycogen deposition in the former. The usual colostrum intakes of n. infants are very low during the first day, but their body reserves can supply the required energy, the major source of carbohydrate being liver glycogen. However, g.r./p. infants require supplementary feeding, the choice of feed being determined by factors such as the intakes the infants can achieve, the carbohydrate content of the feed and the need to ensure a balanced supply of minerals, electrolytes and other substances. In their usual birth environments piglets and lambs, whether growth retarded or not, require colostrum to avoid hypothermia during the first day. The colostrum of both species is rich in lipid, which corrects any deficit in the new-born and thus extends the availability of glycogen, but at the usual colostrum intakes the amounts of lactose can provide sufficient carbohydrate energy for only about half a day. Piglets and lambs, even when fed fully, are therefore obliged to call on their body glycogen reserves in order to make up the difference. After the first day in all three species milk must rapidly become the only source of carbohydrate, lipid and protein. It is suggested that despite differences between them, the piglet or lamb could prove to be useful animal models of the infant's metabolism, but only if the experimental conditions are chosen carefully.},

    abstract = {Abstract Intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) is frequently observed in pig production, especially when using highly prolific sows. IUGR piglets are born with low body weight and shape indicative of differences in organ growth. Insufficient uteroplacental nutrient transfer to the fetuses is the leading cause of growth restriction in the pig. Supplementing the sow's gestation diet with arginine and/or glutamine improves placenta growth and functionality and consequently is able to reduce IUGR incidence. IUGR piglets are at higher risk of dying preweaning and face higher morbidity than their normal-weight littermates. A high level of surveillance during farrowing and individual nutrient supplementation can reduce the mortality rates. Still, these do not reverse the long-term consequences of IUGR, which are induced by persistent structural deficits in different organs. Dietary interventions peri-weaning can optimize performance but these are less effective in combating the metabolic changes that occurred in IUGR, which affect reproductive performance later in life. IUGR piglets share many similarities with IUGR infants, such as a poorer outcome of males. Using the IUGR piglet as an animal model to further explore the structural and molecular basis of the long-term consequences of IUGR and the potential sex bias could aid in fully understanding the impact of prenatal undernutrition and finding solutions for both species and sexes.},

    abstract = {Optimal nutrition early in life is critical to ensure proper structural and functional development of infant organ systems. Although pediatric nutrition historically has emphasized research on the relation between nutrition, growth rates, and gastrointestinal maturation, efforts increasingly have focused on how nutrition influences neurodevelopment. The provision of human milk is considered the gold standard in pediatric nutrition; thus, there is interest in understanding how functional nutrients and bioactive components in milk may modulate developmental processes. The piglet has emerged as an important translational model for studying neurodevelopmental outcomes influenced by pediatric nutrition. Given the comparable nutritional requirements and strikingly similar brain developmental patterns between young pigs and humans, the piglet is being used increasingly in developmental nutritional neuroscience studies. The piglet primarily has been used to assess the effects of dietary fatty acids and their accretion in the brain throughout neurodevelopment. However, recent research indicates that other dietary components, including choline, iron, cholesterol, gangliosides, and sialic acid, among other compounds, also affect neurodevelopment in the pig model. Moreover, novel analytical techniques, including but not limited to MRI, behavioral assessments, and molecular quantification, allow for a more holistic understanding of how nutrition affects neurodevelopmental patterns. By combining early-life nutritional interventions with innovative analytical approaches, opportunities abound to quantify factors affecting neurodevelopmental trajectories in the neonate. This review discusses research using the translational pig model with primary emphasis on early-life nutrition interventions assessing neurodevelopment outcomes, while also discussing nutritionally-sensitive methods to characterize brain maturation.},

Beginning at PD14, performance in a spatial T-maze task was assessed. At PD28, piglets were anesthetized for magnetic resonance (MR) imaging to assess brain structure (voxel-based morphometry), connectivity (diffusion-tensor imaging) and metabolites in the hippocampus and corpus callosum (proton MR spectroscopy). Piglets born SGA showed compensatory growth such that BW of SGA and AGA piglets was similar (P>0.05), by PD15. Birth weight affected maze performance, with SGA piglets taking longer to reach criterion than AGA piglets (p<0.01). Total brain volume of SGA and AGA piglets was similar (P<0.05), but overall, SGA piglets had less gray matter than AGA piglets (p<0.01) and tended to have a smaller internal capsule (p = 0.07). Group comparisons between SGA and AGA piglets defined 9 areas (≥ 20 clusters) where SGA piglets had less white matter (p<0.01); 2 areas where SGA piglets had more white matter (p<0.01); and 3 areas where SGA piglets had more gray matter (p<0.01). The impact of being born SGA on white matter was supported by a lower (p<0.04) fractional anisotropy value for SGA piglets, suggesting reduced white matter development and connectivity. None of the metabolites measured were different between groups. Collectively, the results show that SGA piglets have spatial learning deficits and abnormal development of white matter. As learning deficits and abnormalities in white matter are common in SGA human infants, the piglet is a tractable translational model that can be used to investigate SGA-associated cognitive deficits and potential interventions.},

Hematocrit, hemoglobin, and liver iron were measured to determine iron status.Results: Hematocrit and hemoglobin in ID piglets were less than CON after PD 14 (P \\&lt; 0.001), and at the study end liver iron in ID piglets was less than CON (P \\&lt; 0.001). Brain region volumes were not affected by ID, but changes in brain composition were evident. ID piglets had less white matter in 78,305 voxels, with large clusters in the hippocampus and cortex. ID piglets had less gray matter in 13,625 voxels primarily in cortical areas and more gray matter in 28,017 voxels, most notably in olfactory bulbs and hippocampus. The major effect of ID on white matter was supported by lower fractional anisotropy values in the corpus callosum (0.300 compared with 0.284, P = 0.006) and in whole brain white matter (0.313 compared with 0.307, P = 0.002) in ID piglets. In coronal brain sections, corpus callosum width was less (P = 0.043) in ID piglets. Inositol was lower (P = 0.01) and phosphocholine was higher (P = 0.03) in hippocampus of ID piglets.Conclusions: Postnatal ID in piglets affects brain development, especially white matter. If the effects of ID persist, it might explain the lasting detrimental effects on cognition.}},

    abstract = {{Intrauterine growth retardation (IUGR), defined as impaired growth and development of the mammalian embryo/fetus or its organs during pregnancy, is a major concern in domestic animal production. Fetal growth restriction reduces neonatal survival, has a permanent stunting effect on postnatal growth and the efficiency of feed/forage utilization in offspring, negatively affects whole body composition and meat quality, and impairs long-term health and athletic performance. Knowledge of the underlying mechanisms has important implications for the prevention of IUGR and is crucial for enhancing the efficiency of livestock production and animal health. Fetal growth within the uterus is a complex biological event influenced by genetic, epigenetic, and environmental factors, as well as maternal maturity. These factors impact on the size and functional capacity of the placenta, uteroplacental blood flows, transfer of nutrients and oxygen from mother to fetus, conceptus nutrient availability, the endocrine milieu, and metabolic pathways. Alterations in fetal nutrition and endocrine status may result in developmental adaptations that permanently change the structure, physiology, metabolism, and postnatal growth of the offspring. Impaired placental syntheses of nitric oxide (a major vasodilator and angiogenic factor) and polyamines (key regulators of DNA and protein synthesis) may provide a unified explanation for the etiology of IUGR in response to maternal undernutrition and overnutrition. There is growing evidence that maternal nutritional status can alter the epigenetic state (stable alterations of gene expression through DNA methylation and histone modifications) of the fetal genome. This may provide a molecular mechanism for the role of maternal nutrition on fetal programming and genomic imprinting. Innovative interdisciplinary research in the areas of nutrition, reproductive physiology, and vascular biology will play an important role in designing the next generation of nutrient-balanced gestation diets and developing new tools for livestock management that will enhance the efficiency of animal production and improve animal well being.}},

Our laboratory has developed and validated MRI methods for regional brain volume quantification in the neonatal piglet. The aim of this study was to utilize the MRI-based volume quantification technique in a longitudinal study to determine brain growth in domestic pigs from 2 to 24 weeks of age. MRI data were acquired from pigs 2–24 weeks of age using a 3-dimensional magnetization-prepared gradient echo sequence on a Magnetom Trio 3-tesla imager. Manual segmentation was performed for volume estimates of total brain, cortical, diencephalon, brainstem, cerebellar and hippocampal regions. Logistic modeling procedures were used to characterize brain growth. Total brain volume increased 130\% (±12\%) and 121\% (±7\%) from 2 to 24 weeks in males and females, respectively. The maximum increase in total brain volume occurred about the age of 4 weeks and 95\% of whole brain growth occurred by the age of 21–23 weeks. Logistical modeling suggests there are sexually dimorphic effects on brain growth. For example, in females, the cortex was smaller (p = 0.04). Furthermore, the maximum growth of the hippocampus occurred about 5 weeks earlier in females than males, and the window for hippocampal growth was significantly shorter in females than males (p = 0.02, p = 0.002 respectively). These sexual dimorphisms are similar to what is seen in humans. In addition to providing important data on brain growth for pigs, this study shows pigs can be used to obtain longitudinal MRI data. The large increase in brain volume in the postnatal period is similar to that of human neonates and suggests pigs can be used to investigate brain development.}},

This intrauterine competition greatly influences postnatal traits such as birth weight and vitality (physical strength). A lowered vitality is most often observed among low birth weight piglets. Since it has been argued that locomotion might be key to unraveling vitality-related differences, we compared gait development in piglets with a low birth weight and low vitality (L piglets) with piglets with a normal birth weight and normal vitality (N piglets) by means of spatio-temporal gait analysis during locomotion at self-selected speed. Video recordings of L and N piglets walking along a corridor at ten time points (between birth and 96 h after birth) were made and the footfalls were digitized. Hence, self-selected speed, spatio-temporal characteristics and gait symmetry were analyzed to compare motor performance, neuromotor maturation (motor task, interlimb and intralimb coordination) and gait variability for L and N piglets. The analysis included both absolute and normalized data (according to the dynamic similarity concept), to distinguish neuromotor maturation from effects caused by growth. Results indicate that intrauterine crowding affects locomotion, mainly by impairing growth in utero, with a lowered motor performance during the first 96 h of age as a consequence. A difference in neuromotor skills was also visible, though only for swing and stance duration, implying a difference in neuromotor development in utero. However, further maturation during the first days after birth does not seem to be affected by intrauterine crowding. We can therefore conclude that L piglets might be considered a smaller and fictitious younger version of N piglets.},

Previously, our group described how IUC affects locomotion during the piglet’s first days of life (until 96 h after birth). We noted a reduced motor performance in piglets with a low birth weight and low vitality (L piglets), compared to piglets with a normal birth weight and normal vitality (N piglets), indicating L piglets are unable to produce enough force. Our current study investigates whether this observed force deficit in L piglets is caused by a reduced force generating capacity in the muscles and/or a lower percentage of type II (fast-contracting) fibers. Volume and fiber length of the main extensor muscles of the hind limb were used to estimate the physiological cross-sectional area (PSCA) and hence calculate the maximal isometric force generating capacity (Fiso-max) of the hind limb. To check for developmental differences between the muscles of L and N piglets, Fiso-max was normalized to body weight (BW), thus yielding a dimensionless variable F’iso-max. To check for differences in muscle composition, m. vastus lateralis was stained immunohistochemically in order to determine the percentage of type II fibers through image analysis. Our results indicate that L piglets have a reduced absolute force generating capacity due to a lesser muscle mass, compared to N piglets. However, when normalized to BW L piglets actually show a larger force generating capacity, suggesting their muscles are more voluminous, given their body mass, than those of N piglets. However, no differences between L and N piglets were detected with regard to muscle composition of the m. vastus lateralis. Based on our data, we can say that neither normalized force generating capacity, nor muscle composition (of the m. vastus lateralis) can explain the observed force deficit in L piglets and as such the effect of IUC on locomotor performance.},

Cesarean-delivered preterm (n = 112, 90\% gestation) or term (n = 56, 100\% gestation) piglets were reared under identical conditions and euthanized for blood and organ collection on postnatal days 0, 5, or 26. Body weight gain remained lower in preterm vs. term pigs up to day 26 (25.5 ± 1.5 vs. 31.0 ± 0.5 g·kg−1·day−1, P < 0.01) when relative weights were higher for brain and kidneys and reduced for liver and spleen. Neonatal preterm pigs had reduced values for blood pH, Po2, glucose, lactate, hematocrit, and cortisol, but at day 26, most values were normalized, although plasma serotonin and IGF 1 levels remained reduced. Preterm pigs showed delayed neonatal arousal and impaired physical activity, coordination, exploration, and learning, relative to term pigs (all P < 0.05). Supplementation of parenteral nutrition during the first 5 days with an enteral milk diet did not affect later outcomes. In preterm pigs, many physiological characteristics of immaturity disappeared by 4 wk, while some neurodevelopmental deficits remained. The preterm pig is a relevant animal model to study early dietary and pharmacological interventions that support postnatal maturation and neurodevelopment in preterm infants.},

In the course of domestication, sows have not lost their instinctive behaviour to nest-build, but perform at least elements of it when appropriate space and materials are available. The onset and performance of nest-building is both stimulated internally via hormones and externally via feedback from the environment. With this environmental influence, the possibilities to perform nest-building can be restricted to different extents in commercially farmed pigs. The aim of the present review is to point out the sow's need for nest-building performance as part of the natural behaviour pattern, although they are kept in different modern housing systems. With regard to increased demands for animal welfare and following changes in the legislation for pig husbandry, possible consequences for different housing systems are discussed.},

Building on basic mechanical principles (momentum only changes when external forces/moments act on the body), insights into possible strategies for such a dynamical mode transition are provided and applied first to the recorded planar kinematics of an example walking sequence (including several continuous quadrupedal, transition and subsequent bipedal steps). Body dynamics are calculated from the kinematics. The strategy used in this worked example boils down to: crouch the hind parts and sprint them underneath the rising body centre of mass. Forward accelerations are not in play. Key characteristics of this transition strategy were extracted: progression speed, hip height, step duration (frequency), foot positioning at touchdown with respect to the hip and the body centre of mass (BCoM), and congruity between the moments of the ground reaction force about the BCoM and the rate of change of the total angular moment. Statistical analyses across the full sample (15 transitions of 10 individuals) confirm this strategy is always used and is shared across individuals. Finally, the costs (in J kg−1 m−1) linked to on the fly transitions were estimated. The costs are approximately double those of both the preceding quadrupedal and subsequent bipedal walking. Given the short duration of the transition as such (\\&lt;1 s), it is argued that the energetic costs to change walking posture on the fly are negligible when considered in the context of the locomotor repertoire.}},

Non-human primates (NHPs) are often considered the ultimate and widely used animal model for neuroscience studies, including BCIs V&V, due to their proximity to humans. This literature review summarizes 94 NHP gait analysis studies until 1 June, 2022, including seven BCI-oriented studies. Due to technological limitations, most of these studies used wired neural recordings to access electrophysiological data. However, wireless neural recording systems for NHPs enabled neuroscience research in humans, and many on NHP locomotion, while posing numerous technical challenges, such as signal quality, data throughout, working distance, size, and power constraint, that have yet to be overcome. Besides neurological data, motion capture (MoCap) systems are usually required in BCI and gait studies to capture locomotion kinematics. However, current studies have exclusively relied on image processing-based MoCap systems, which have insufficient accuracy (error: ≥4° and 9 mm). While the role of the motor cortex during locomotion is still unclear and worth further exploration, future BCI and gait studies require simultaneous, high-speed, accurate neurophysiological, and movement measures. Therefore, the infrared MoCap system which has high accuracy and speed, together with a high spatiotemporal resolution neural recording system, may expand the scope and improve the quality of the motor and neurophysiological analysis in NHPs.},

SCI in dogs can be considered as intermediate between rodent models and human clinical trials, but the primate models could help to develop appropriate methods that might be more relevant to humans. Ideally, an animal model should meet the requirements of availability and repeatability as well as reproduce the anatomical features and the clinical pathological changing process of SCI. An animal model that completely simulates SCI in humans does not exist. The different experimental models of SCI have advantages and disadvantages for investigating the different aspects of lesion development, recovery mechanisms and potential therapeutic interventions. The potential advantages of non-human primate models include genetic similarities, similar caliber/length of the spinal cord as well as biological and physiological responses to injury which are more similar to humans. Among the potential disadvantages, high operating costs, infrastructural requirements and ethical concerns should be considered.

Most previous research has focused on adult primates, but in the last few decades, increased attention to locomotor development has provided new insights toward our broader understanding of primate adaptation and evolution. Here, we review the contributions of this body of work from three basic perspectives. First, we assess possible determinants on the timing of locomotor independence, an important life history event. Significant influences on timing of locomotor independence include adult female body mass, age at weaning, and especially relative brain size, a significant predictor of other primate life history variables. Additionally, we found significant phylogenetic differences in the timing of locomotor independence, even accounting for these influences. Second, we discuss how structural aspects of primate growth may enhance the locomotor performance and safety of young primates, despite their inherent neuromotor and musculoskeletal limitations. For example, compared to adults, growing primates have greater muscle mechanical advantage, greater bone robusticity, and larger extremities with relatively long digits. Third, focusing on primate quadrupedalism, we provide examples that illustrate how ontogenetic transitions in morphology and locomotion can serve as a model system for testing broader principles underlying primate locomotor biomechanics. This approach has led to a better understanding of the key features that contribute to primates’ stride characteristics, gait patterns, limb force distribution, and limb postures. We have learned a great deal from the study of locomotor ontogeny, but there is much left to explore. We conclude by offering guidelines for future research, both in the laboratory and the field.},

Here, we tested whether very young individuals show near-maximal levels of grasping strength, and whether such an early onset of grasping performance could be explained by ontogenetic variability in the morphology of the limbs in baboons. Material and methods We quantified a performance trait, hand pull strength, at the juvenile and adult stages in a cross-sectional sample of 15 olive baboons (Papio anubis). We also quantified bone dimensions (i.e., lengths, widths, and heights) of the fore- (n = 25) and hind limb (n = 21) elements based on osteological collections covering the whole development of olive baboons. Results One-year old individuals demonstrated very high pull strengths (i.e., 200\% of the adult performance, relative to body mass), that are consistent with relatively wider phalanges and digit joints in juveniles. The mature proportions and shape of the forelimb elements appeared only at full adulthood (i.e., ≥4.5 years), whereas the mature hind limb proportions and shape were observed much earlier during development. Discussion These changes in limb performance and morphology across ontogeny may be explained with regard to behavioral transitions that olive baboons experience during their development. Our findings highlight the effect of infant clinging to mother, an often-neglected feature when discussing the origins of grasping in primates. The differences in growth patterns, we found between the forelimb and the hind limb further illustrate their different functional roles, having likely evolved under different ecological pressures (manipulation and locomotion, respectively).},

This longitudinal and ontogenetic study has produced the largest dataset to date of segmental morphometrics in a Catarrhini species, the olive baboon. The objectives of the study were to quantify the changes in body linear and inertial dimensions and to explore their (theoretical) mechanical significance for locomotion. We took full-body measurements of captive individuals at regular intervals. Altogether, 14 females and 16 males were followed over a 7-year period, i.e. from infancy to adulthood. Our results show that individual patterns of growth are very consistent and follow the general growth pattern previously described in olive baboons. Furthermore, we obtained similar growth curve structures for segment lengths and masses, although the respective time scales were slightly different. The most significant changes in body morphometrics occurred during the first 2 years of life and concerned the distal parts of the body. Females and males were similar in size and shape at birth. The rate and duration of growth produced substantial size-related differences throughout ontogeny, while body shapes remained very similar between the sexes. We also observed significant age-related variations in limb composition, with a proximal shift of the centre of mass within the limbs, mainly due to changes in mass distribution and in the length of distal segments. Finally, we observed what we hypothesize to be ‘early biomechanical optimization’ of the limbs for quadrupedal walking. This is due to a high degree of convergence between the limbs’ natural pendular periods in infants, which may facilitate the onset of quadrupedal walking. Furthermore, the mechanical significance of the morphological changes observed in growing baboons may be related to changing functional demands with the onset of autonomous (quadrupedal) locomotion. From a wider perspective, these data provide unique insights into questions surrounding both the processes of locomotor development in primates and how these processes might evolve.},

Thus, structural, functional, and microbiologic indices were used to investigate the etiology of spontaneous NEC development in preterm pigs. Methods: Piglets were delivered by cesarean section at 92\% gestation, reared in infant incubators, and fed infant formula or colostrum every 3 hours (n = 120) until tissue collection at 1–2 days of age. Results: Clinical and histopathologic signs of NEC were observed in 57\% of pigs fed FORMULA (26/46) and in 5\% of pigs fed COLOSTRUM (2/38) (P < .05). Relative to COLOSTRUM, both healthy and sick FORMULA pigs had reduced intestinal villous heights, enzyme activities, nutrient absorption, and antioxidant levels and higher inducible nitric oxide synthetase activity (P < .05). In healthy pigs, mucosal microbial diversity remained low and diet independent. NEC pigs showed bacterial overgrowth, and a high mucosal density of Clostridium perfringens was detected in some but not all pigs. Germ-free conditions and antiserum against Clostridium perfringens toxin prevented intestinal dysfunction and NEC in formula-fed pigs, whereas the gut trophic factors, epidermal growth factor, and glucagon-like peptide 2 had limited effects. Conclusions: A subclinical, formula-induced mucosal atrophy and dysfunction predispose to NEC and bacterial overgrowth. The adverse feeding effects are colonization dependent and may be reduced by factors in colostrum that include antibodies against aggressive toxins such as those of Clostridium perfringens.}},

    abstract = {Background: Preterm infants frequently show neuromotor dysfunctions, but it is not clear how reduced gestational age at birth may induce developmental coordination disorders. Advancing postnatal age, not only post-conceptional age, may determine neuromuscular development, and early interventions in preterm newborns may improve their later motor skills. An animal model of preterm birth that allows early postnatal detection of movement patterns may help to investigate this hypothesis.Methods: Using pigs as a model for moderately preterm infants, preterm (106-day gestation, equivalent to 90\% of normal gestation time; n = 38) and term (115-day gestation, equivalent to 99\% of normal gestation time; n = 20) individuals were delivered by cesarean section and artificially reared until postnatal day 19 (preweaning period). The neuromotor skills of piglets were documented using spatiotemporal gait analyses on video recordings of locomotion at self-selected speed at postnatal age 3, 4, 5, 8, and 18 days. Results were controlled for effects of body weight and sex.Results: Both preterm and term piglets reached mature neuromotor skills and performance between postnatal days 3–5. However, preterm pigs took shorter steps at a higher frequency, than term piglets, irrespective of their body size. Within preterm pigs, males and low birth weight individuals took the shortest steps, and with the highest frequency.Conclusion: Postnatal development of motor skills and gait characteristics in pigs delivered in late gestation may show similarity to the compromised development of gait pattern in preterm infants. Relative to term pigs, the postnatal delay in gait development in preterm pigs was only few days, that is, much shorter than the 10-day reduction in gestation length. This indicates rapid postnatal adaptation of gait pattern after reduced gestational age at birth. Early-life physical training and medical interventions may support both short- and long-term gait development after preterm birth in both pigs and infants.},

Simulations that predict movement patterns based on a mathematical model of the neuro-musculoskeletal system without relying on experimental data can reveal principles of locomotion by elucidating cause–effect relationships. New computational approaches have enabled the use of such predictive simulations with complex neuro-musculoskeletal models. Here, we review recent advances in predictive simulations of human movement and how those simulations have been used to deepen our knowledge about the neuromechanics of gait. In addition, we give a perspective on challenges towards using predictive simulations to gain new fundamental insight into motor control of gait, and to help design personalized treatments in patients with neurological disorders and assistive devices that improve gait performance. Such applications will require more detailed neuro-musculoskeletal models and simulation approaches that take uncertainty into account, tools to efficiently personalize those models, and validation studies to demonstrate the ability of simulations to predict gait in novel circumstances. },

Combining in vivo kinematics of quadrupedal mammals with a computer model, we show that the timing of vertical displacements of the head and neck is consistent with minimizing energy expenditure for carrying these body parts in an inverted pendulum walking gait. Varying the timing of head movements in the model resulted in increased metabolic cost estimate for carrying the head and neck of up to 63\%. Oscillations of the head–neck unit result in weight force oscillations transmitted to the forelimbs. Advantageous timing increases the load in single support phases, in which redirecting the trajectory of the centre of mass (COM) is thought to be energetically inexpensive. During double support, in which—according to collision mechanics—directional changes of the impulse of the COM are expensive, the observed timing decreases the load. Because the head and neck comprise approximately 10\% of body mass, the effect shown here should also affect the animals' overall energy expenditure. This mechanism, working analogously in high-tech backpacks for energy-saving load carriage, is widespread in ungulates, and provides insight into how animals economize locomotion. },

    abstract = {{The pace of locomotor development is a critical component of lifetime evolutionary fitness. Developmental researchers often divide species into two broad categories based on functional competence at birth: precocial infants who can independently stand and locomote soon after birth versus altricial infants who are either incapable of independent movement or can only do so in a rudimentary manner. However, investigating the lower level neuromotor and biomechanical traits that account for perinatal variation in motor development is complicated by the lack of experimental control inherent to all comparative analyses. Precocial and altricial animals often differ along a host of dimensions that can obfuscate the specific factors controlling motor development per se. Here, we propose an alternative approach of examining locomotor development in a nominally precocial species—the domestic pig (Sus scrofa)—in which gestation length has been experimentally manipulated, thereby creating “functionally altricial” cohorts for comparison. We have used standard biomechanical testing to evaluate balance and locomotor performance in preterm pigs born at 94\% full-term gestation (N = 29 individuals) and compared these data to a similar dataset on age-matched full-term piglets (N = 15 individuals). Static balance tests showed that preterm pigs were characterized by increased postural sway, particularly in the fore-aft (anteroposterior) direction. Locomotor analyses showed that preterm piglets tended to take shorter, more frequent strides, use higher duty factors, and preferentially choose gait patterns that ensured they were supported by at least three limbs during most of the stride cycle, though differences between preterm and full-term animals were often modulated by variation in locomotor speed. Morphometric analysis showed no differences in relative extensor muscle mass between preterm and full-term animals, suggesting that neurological immaturity might be more determinant of preterm piglet motor dysfunctions than musculoskeletal immaturity per se (though much work remains to be done to fully document the neuromotor phenotype of the preterm infant pig model). In many ways, the postural and locomotor deficits shown by the preterm piglets paralleled the locomotor phenotype of altricial mammals. Overall, our study demonstrates the utility of a “within-species” design for studying the biomechanical correlates and neuromotor basis of evolutionary variation in motor skill at birth.}},

Precociality requires a bony skeleton of sufficient strength to resist mechanical loading during early locomotor efforts. The aim of this study was to use an animal model—the preterm infant pig—to investigate some of the proximate factors that might determine variation in bone strength in precocial animals. Based on the prior literature, we tested the null predictions that skeletal integrity would be significantly compromised by truncated gestation (i.e., preterm birth) and reduced body mass at birth. We generated a suite of both morphometric measures (tissue mineral density and cross-sectional geometry) and performance-related metrics (ability to resist loading, deformation, and fracture during three-point bending tests) of the appendicular skeleton of preterm and full-term infant pigs. Results showed that very few measures in our ontogenetic infant pig sample significantly varied with either gestation length or birth mass. Overall, our results contribute to a growing body of literature demonstrating the early functional capacity of the precocial infant musculoskeletal system and suggest that bone strength in perinatal precocial mammals may be robust to the factors shown to compromise skeletal integrity in more altricial taxa.},

Dynamic analysis of the vertical jumps performed by two bushbabies confirms the need for a power amplifier. Inverse dynamics coupled to a geometric musculo–skeletal model were used to elucidate the precise nature of the mechanism powering maximal vertical jumps. Most of the power required for jumping is delivered by the vastus muscle–tendon systems (knee extensor). Comparison with the external joint–powers revealed, however, an important power transport from this extensor (about 65\%) to the ankle and the midfoot via the bi–articular calf muscles. Peak power output likely implies elastic recoil of the complex aponeurotic system of the vastus muscle. Patterns of changes in length and tension of the muscle–tendon complex during different phases of the jump were found which provide strong evidence for substantial power amplification (times 15). It is argued here that the multiple internal connective tissue sheets and attachment structures of the well–developed bundles of the vastus muscle become increasingly stretched during preparatory crouching and throughout the extension phase, except for the last 13 ms of the push–off (i.e. when power requirements peak). Then, tension in the knee extensors abruptly falls from its maximum, allowing the necessary fast recoil of the tensed tendon structures to occur. },

    abstract = {Therian mammals are known to move their forelimbs in a parasagittal plane, retracting the mobilised scapula during stance phase. Non-cursorial therian mammals often abduct the elbow out of the shoulder–hip parasagittal plane. This is especially prominent in Tamandua (Xenarthra), which suggests they employ aspects of sprawling (e.g. lizard-like) locomotion. Here, we tested whether tamanduas use sprawling forelimb kinematics, i.e. a largely immobile scapula with pronounced lateral spine bending and long-axis rotation of the humerus. We analysed high-speed videos and used X-ray motion analysis of tamanduas walking and balancing on branches of varying inclinations and provide a quantitative characterization of gaits and forelimb kinematics. Tamanduas displayed lateral sequence/lateral couplets on flat ground and horizontal branches, but increased diagonality on steeper inclines and declines, resulting in lateral sequence/diagonal couplets gaits. This result provides further evidence for high diagonality in arboreal species, probably maximising stability in arboreal environments. Further, the results reveal a mosaic of sprawling and parasagittal kinematic characteristics. The abducted elbow results from a constantly internally rotated scapula about its long axis and a retracted humerus. Scapula retraction contributes considerably to stride length. However, lateral rotation in the pectoral region of the spine (range: 21 deg) is higher than reported for other therian mammals. Instead, it is similar to that of skinks and alligators, indicating an aspect generally associated with sprawling locomotion is characteristic for forelimb kinematics of tamanduas. Our study contributes to a growing body of evidence of highly variable non-cursorial therian mammal locomotor kinematics.},

Several species are hypothesized to use a catapult-like mechanism to store and rapidly release elastic energy, producing power outputs far beyond the capability of muscle. Most evidence for this mechanism comes from measurements of whole-body power output; the decoupling of joint motion and muscle shortening expected in a catapult-like mechanism has not been demonstrated. We used high-speed marker-based biplanar X-ray cinefluoroscopy to quantify plantaris muscle fascicle strain and ankle joint motion in frogs in order to test for two hallmarks of a catapult mechanism: (i) shortening of fascicles prior to joint movement (during tendon stretch), and (ii) rapid joint movement during the jump without rapid muscle-shortening (during tendon recoil). During all jumps, muscle fascicles shortened by an average of 7.8 per cent (54\% of total strain) prior to joint movement, stretching the tendon. The subsequent period of initial joint movement and high joint angular acceleration occurred with minimal muscle fascicle length change, consistent with the recoil of the elastic tendon. These data support the plantaris longus tendon as a site of elastic energy storage during frog jumping, and demonstrate that catapult mechanisms may be employed even in sub-maximal jumps. },

The most widely accepted model for upper bill elevation is that the quadrate rotates rostrally and medially towards the pterygoid, transferring force to the mobile pterygoid–palatine complex, which pushes on the upper bill. Until now, however, it has not been possible to test this hypothesis in vivo because quadrate motions are rapid, three-dimensionally complex and not visible externally. Here we use a new in vivo X-ray motion analysis technique, X-ray reconstruction of moving morphology (XROMM), to create precise (±0.06 mm) 3-D animations of the quadrate, braincase, upper bill and mandible of three mallard ducks, Anas platyrhynchos. We defined a joint coordinate system (JCS) for the quadrato-squamosal joint with the axes aligned to the anatomical planes of the skull. In this coordinate system, the quadrate's 3-D rotations produce an elliptical path of pterygoid process motion, with medial and rostrodorsal then lateral and rostrodorsal motion as the upper bill elevates. As the upper bill depresses, the pterygoid process continues along the ellipsoidal path, with lateral and caudoventral then medial and caudoventral motion. We also found that the mandibular rami bow outwards (streptognathy) during mandibular depression, which may cause the lateral component of quadrate rotation that we observed. Relative to the JCS aligned with the anatomical planes of the skull, a second JCS aligned with quadrato-squamosal joint anatomy did not produce a simpler description of quadrate kinematics.},

Many mammal jaw joints, by contrast, operate in more complex, three-dimensional (3D) ways, involving not only vertical but also propalinal (rostro-caudal) and transverse (lateral) movements. Data on intraoral food processing in lissamphibians and sauropsids has prompted a generally accepted view that these groups mostly swallow food unreduced, and that in those cases where lissamphibians and sauropsids chew, they mostly use simple vertical jaw movements for food processing. The exception to this generally accepted view is the occurrence of some propalinal chewing in sauropsids. We combined 3D kinematics and morphological analyses from biplanar high-speed video fluoroscopy and micro-computed tomography to determine how the paedomorphic salamander Siren intermedia treats captured food. We discovered not only that S. intermedia uses intraoral food processing but also that the elaborated morphology of its jaw joint facilitates mandibular motions in all three planes, resulting in complex 3D chewing. Thus, our data challenge the commonly held view that complex 3D chewing movements are exclusive to mammals, by suggesting that such mechanisms might have evolved early in the tetrapod evolution.},

The presence and functional significance of cranial kinesis has been investigated in various vertebrates, with much of our understanding coming from comparative studies and manipulation of ligamentous specimens. Drawing on these studies, cranial kinesis in lizards has been modeled as a four-bar linkage system involving streptostyly (rotation of the quadrate), hypokinesis (dorsoventral flexion and extension of the palato-maxillary sub-unit), mesokinesis (dorsoventral flexion and extension of the snout at the fronto-parietal suture) and metakinesis (sliding movements between parietal and supraocciptal bones). In vivo studies, although limited, suggest that cranial kinesis serves an important role during routine behaviors such as feeding. Here, we use X-ray Reconstruction Of Moving Morphology to further quantify mesokinesis in vivo in Gekko gecko during three routine behaviors: gape display, biting and post-ingestion feeding. During gape display, the snout rotates dorsally above rest position, with mesokinesis accounting for a 10\% increase in maximum gape over that achieved solely by the depression of the lower jaw. During defensive biting, the snout rotates ventrally below rest position to participate in gape closure. Finally, ventroflexion of the snout also occurs during post-ingestion feeding, accounting for 42\% of gape closure during intra-oral transport, 86\% during puncture-crushing, and 61\% during pharyngeal packing. Mesokinesis thus appears to facilitate prey puncturing by allowing the snout to rotate ventrally so that the upper teeth pierce the prey item, thus limiting the need for large movements of the lower jaw. This is suggested to maintain a firm grip on the prey and reduce the possibility of prey escape. More generally, this study demonstrates that mesokinesis is a key component of defensive biting and gape display behaviors, as well as post-ingestion feeding, all of which are linked to organismal fitness.},
