#+title: Acknowledgements

I am grateful for my time at Campus Drie Eiken, and wholeheartedly enjoyed being around for so long.
In all the groups which accomodated me, I was welcomed with a supportive, friendly, collaborative, and creative atmosphere, which is all due to the great people I met there.

from "arkdienst" to "z..."


"office roommates": Miriam Ayuso Hernando, Lieselotte Van Bockstal, Sara Prims, Joaquim Sanctorum, Simon Baeckens, and of course Maja.
A special shoutout to the phenomenal technical and administrative support for who I caused a lot of work: Katty Huybrechts, Gunther Vrolix, Steve Van Bienst, Josie Meaney-Ward, and Jan Scholliers.

Not to forget my supervisors
