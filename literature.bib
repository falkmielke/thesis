The dataset was extracted from 1614 published and unpublished measurements in 1156 subjects after exclusion of repeat estimates and subjects in special physiological or behavioural states (eg pregnancy, athletic or military training etc).&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;A separate analysis of data from non-ambulant subjects, and from elite endurance athletes (all excluded from the main dataset) established the limits of human daily energy expenditure at around 1.2 x BMR and 4.5 x BMR. In the main analysis, the validity of PAL as an index of TEE adjusted for BMR was tested and confirmed. Regression equations were then derived to describe TEE, BMR, AEE and PAL in terms of body weight, height, age and sex. As anticipated, TEE, BMR and AEE were all positively related to weight and height, while age was a negative predictor, especially of activity. The influence of weight disappeared when TEE was expressed as PAL, but height and age remained as highly significant predictors. For all three components, females expended 11% less energy on average than males after adjustment for weight, height and age. Average levels of energy expenditure in different age and sex groups are tabulated.&lt;h4&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h4&gt;There now exists a large and robust database of energy expenditure measurements obtained by the doubly-labelled water method. Analysis of the data from affluent societies shows that, in general, levels of energy expenditure are similar to the recommendations for energy requirements adopted by FAO/WHO/UNU (1985) and UK Department of Health (1991). PAL values for active subjects tend to be higher than is currently assumed. The current analysis provides a substantial body of normal data against which other estimates can be compared.},

    abstract = {{Here, I describe foraging behavior of goldcrests, Regulus regulus, based on eight years of field observation in a coniferous forest dominated by Norway spruce Picea abies in southwestern Sweden. The aim was to test predictions from theory on the choice of optimal foraging modes in relation to food availability. Mortality from early November to early March amounts to 70–86\% among goldcrests in the resident population, suggesting they are food-limited in winter. Food-limitation manifests itself as a shortage of time for foraging. It promotes the use of foraging methods that minimize the daily foraging time by maximizing the rate of net energy gain. It increases both individual survival and competitiveness. Elimination of competitors by exploitation occurs when an individual is able to support itself, while food density in the habitat is reduced to levels at which others cannot. Theory shows that when food is abundant, high-efficiency energy-expensive search and capture methods give shorter daily foraging times than low-efficiency low-cost methods, whereas the latter gives shorter daily foraging times at food shortages (Norberg 2021). Hovering flight is extremely expensive in energy but results in high foraging efficiency. Hover-foraging should therefore be used when food is abundant. In autumn, there were 85.3 arthropods per kilogram of branch mass, as opposed to 12.9 in spring. The numerical decline of arthropods, their fat metabolism, and size-biased predation by birds reduced the spring density of food for goldcrests to less than 15.1\% of the autumn density. Hover-foraging occurred 5.29 times per minute in autumn but only 0.23 times per minute in spring, which is 4.4\% of the autumn frequency. Foraging conditions are favorable at midsummer because of long days, high temperatures, and an abundance of arthropod prey. Parent birds that were feeding fledglings gathered food at a high rate and hovered 5.42 times per minute. But adults with no young to feed were not compelled to maximize the rate of net energy gain and only hover-foraged 0.52 times per minute, which is 10\% of that of providers. These results are highly consistent from year to year and in qualitative agreement with theory.}},

    abstract = {{The alleged high net energy cost of running and low net energy cost of walking in humans have played an important role in the interpretation of the evolution of human bipedalism and the biomechanical determinants of the metabolic cost of locomotion. This study re-explores how the net metabolic energy cost of running and walking (J kg–1m–1) in humans compares to that of animals of similar mass using new allometric analyses of previously published data. Firstly, this study shows that the use of the slope of the regression between the rate of energy expenditure and speed to calculate the net energy cost of locomotion overestimates the net cost of human running. Also, the net energy cost of human running is only 17\% higher than that predicted based on their mass. This value is not exceptional given that over a quarter of the previously examined mammals and birds have a net energy cost of running that is 17\% or more above their allometrically predicted value. Using a new allometric equation for the net energy cost of walking, this study also shows that human walking is 20\%less expensive than predicted for their mass. Of the animals used to generate this equation, 25\% have a relatively lower net cost of walking compared with their allometrically predicted value. This new walking allometric analysis also indicates that the scaling of the net energy cost of locomotion with body mass is gait dependent. In conclusion, the net costs of running and walking in humans are moderately different from those predicted from allometry and are not remarkable for an animal of its size.}},

    abstract = {{This series of four papers investigates the link between the energetics and the mechanics of terrestrial locomotion. Two experimental variables are used throughout the study: speed and body size. Mass-specific metabolic rates of running animals can be varied by about tenfold using either variable. This first paper considers metabolic energy consumed during terrestrial locomotion. New data relating rate of oxygen consumption and speed are reported for: eight species of wild and domestic artiodactyls; seven species of carnivores; four species of primates; and one species of rodent. These are combined with previously published data to formulate a new allometric equation relating mass-specific rates of oxygen consumed (VO2/Mb) during locomotion at a constant speed to speed and body mass (based on data from 62 avian and mammalian species): VO2/Mb = 0.533 Mb-0.316.vg + 0.300 Mb-0.303 where VO2/Mb has the units ml O2 s-1 kg-1; Mb is in kg; and vg is in m s-1. This equation can be expressed in terms of mass-specific rates of energy consumption (Emetab/Mb) using the energetic equivalent of 1 ml O2 = 20.1 J because the contribution of anaerobic glycolysis was negligible: Emetab/Mb = 10.7 Mb-0.316.vg + 6.03 Mb-0.303 where Emetab/Mb has the units watts/kg. This new relationship applies equally well to bipeds and quadrupeds and differs little from the allometric equation reported 12 years ago by Taylor, Schmid-Nielsen \\&amp; Raab (1970). Ninety per cent of the values calculated from this genera equation for the diverse assortment of avian and mammalian species included in this regression fall within 25\% of the observed values at the middle of the speed range where measurements were made. This agreement is impressive when one considers that mass-specific rates of oxygen consumption differed by more than 1400\% over this size range of animals.}},
