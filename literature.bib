The dataset was extracted from 1614 published and unpublished measurements in 1156 subjects after exclusion of repeat estimates and subjects in special physiological or behavioural states (eg pregnancy, athletic or military training etc).&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;A separate analysis of data from non-ambulant subjects, and from elite endurance athletes (all excluded from the main dataset) established the limits of human daily energy expenditure at around 1.2 x BMR and 4.5 x BMR. In the main analysis, the validity of PAL as an index of TEE adjusted for BMR was tested and confirmed. Regression equations were then derived to describe TEE, BMR, AEE and PAL in terms of body weight, height, age and sex. As anticipated, TEE, BMR and AEE were all positively related to weight and height, while age was a negative predictor, especially of activity. The influence of weight disappeared when TEE was expressed as PAL, but height and age remained as highly significant predictors. For all three components, females expended 11% less energy on average than males after adjustment for weight, height and age. Average levels of energy expenditure in different age and sex groups are tabulated.&lt;h4&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h4&gt;There now exists a large and robust database of energy expenditure measurements obtained by the doubly-labelled water method. Analysis of the data from affluent societies shows that, in general, levels of energy expenditure are similar to the recommendations for energy requirements adopted by FAO/WHO/UNU (1985) and UK Department of Health (1991). PAL values for active subjects tend to be higher than is currently assumed. The current analysis provides a substantial body of normal data against which other estimates can be compared.},

    abstract = {1. The aim of this study was to find kinematic patterns that are invariant across the normal range of locomotion speeds. Subjects walked at different, freely chosen speeds ranging from 0.9 to 2.1 m s-1, while motion and ground reaction forces on the right side of the body were recorded in three-dimensional space. 2. The time course of the anatomical angles of flexion-extension at the hip and ankle was variable not only across subjects, but even from trial to trial in the same subject. By contrast, the time course of the changes in the angles of elevation of each limb segment (pelvis, thigh, shank and foot) relative to the vertical was stereotyped across subjects. 3. To compare the waveforms across speeds, data were scaled in time relative to gait cycle duration. The pattern of ground reaction forces was highly speed dependent. Several distinct families of curves could be recognized in the flexion-extension angles at the hip and ankle. Instead, the waveforms of global length and elevation of the limb, elevation angles of all limb segments and flexion-extension at the knee were invariant with speed. 4. When gait trajectories at all speeds are plotted in the position space defined by the elevation angles of the limb segments, they describe regular loops on a plane. The statistical characteristics of these angular covariations were quantified by means of principal component analysis. The first two principal components accounted together for > 99\% of the total experimental variance, and were quantitatively comparable in all subjects. 5. This constraint of planar covariation of the elevation angles is closely reminiscent of that previously described for the control of posture. The existence of laws of intersegmental co-ordination, common to the control of posture and locomotion, presumably assures the maintenance of dynamic equilibrium during forward progression, and the anticipatory adaptation to potentially destabilizing factors by means of co-ordinated kinematic synergies of the whole body.},

    abstract = { Leg segment rotations in human walking covary, so that the three-dimensional trajectory of temporal changes in the elevation angles lies close to a plane. Recently the role of central versus biomechanical constraints on the kinematics control of human locomotion has been questioned. Here we show, based on both modeling and experimental data, that the planar law of intersegmental coordination is not a simple consequence of biomechanics. First, the full limb behavior in various locomotion modes (walking on inclined surface, staircase stepping, air-stepping, crouched walking, hopping) can be expressed as 2 degrees of freedom planar motion even though the orientation of the plane and pairwise segment angle correlations may differ substantially. Second, planar covariation is not an inevitable outcome of any locomotor movement. It can be systematically violated in some conditions (e.g., when stooping and grasping an object on the floor during walking or in toddlers at the onset of independent walking) or transferred into a simple linear relationship in others (e.g., during stepping in place). Finally, all three major limb segments contribute importantly to planar covariation and its characteristics resulting in a certain endpoint trajectory defined by the limb axis length and orientation. Recent advances in the neural control of movement support the hypothesis about central representation of kinematics components. },

    abstract = {{Here, I describe foraging behavior of goldcrests, Regulus regulus, based on eight years of field observation in a coniferous forest dominated by Norway spruce Picea abies in southwestern Sweden. The aim was to test predictions from theory on the choice of optimal foraging modes in relation to food availability. Mortality from early November to early March amounts to 70â€“86\% among goldcrests in the resident population, suggesting they are food-limited in winter. Food-limitation manifests itself as a shortage of time for foraging. It promotes the use of foraging methods that minimize the daily foraging time by maximizing the rate of net energy gain. It increases both individual survival and competitiveness. Elimination of competitors by exploitation occurs when an individual is able to support itself, while food density in the habitat is reduced to levels at which others cannot. Theory shows that when food is abundant, high-efficiency energy-expensive search and capture methods give shorter daily foraging times than low-efficiency low-cost methods, whereas the latter gives shorter daily foraging times at food shortages (Norberg 2021). Hovering flight is extremely expensive in energy but results in high foraging efficiency. Hover-foraging should therefore be used when food is abundant. In autumn, there were 85.3 arthropods per kilogram of branch mass, as opposed to 12.9 in spring. The numerical decline of arthropods, their fat metabolism, and size-biased predation by birds reduced the spring density of food for goldcrests to less than 15.1\% of the autumn density. Hover-foraging occurred 5.29 times per minute in autumn but only 0.23 times per minute in spring, which is 4.4\% of the autumn frequency. Foraging conditions are favorable at midsummer because of long days, high temperatures, and an abundance of arthropod prey. Parent birds that were feeding fledglings gathered food at a high rate and hovered 5.42 times per minute. But adults with no young to feed were not compelled to maximize the rate of net energy gain and only hover-foraged 0.52 times per minute, which is 10\% of that of providers. These results are highly consistent from year to year and in qualitative agreement with theory.}},

This study re-explores how the net metabolic energy cost of running and walking (J kgâ€“1mâ€“1) in humans compares to that of animals of similar mass using new allometric analyses of previously published data. Firstly, this study shows that the use of the slope of the regression between the rate of energy expenditure and speed to calculate the net energy cost of locomotion overestimates the net cost of human running. Also, the net energy cost of human running is only 17\% higher than that predicted based on their mass. This value is not exceptional given that over a quarter of the previously examined mammals and birds have a net energy cost of running that is 17\% or more above their allometrically predicted value. Using a new allometric equation for the net energy cost of walking, this study also shows that human walking is 20\%less expensive than predicted for their mass. Of the animals used to generate this equation, 25\% have a relatively lower net cost of walking compared with their allometrically predicted value. This new walking allometric analysis also indicates that the scaling of the net energy cost of locomotion with body mass is gait dependent. In conclusion, the net costs of running and walking in humans are moderately different from those predicted from allometry and are not remarkable for an animal of its size.}},

Thus, structural, functional, and microbiologic indices were used to investigate the etiology of spontaneous NEC development in preterm pigs. Methods: Piglets were delivered by cesarean section at 92\% gestation, reared in infant incubators, and fed infant formula or colostrum every 3 hours (n = 120) until tissue collection at 1â€“2 days of age. Results: Clinical and histopathologic signs of NEC were observed in 57\% of pigs fed FORMULA (26/46) and in 5\% of pigs fed COLOSTRUM (2/38) (P < .05). Relative to COLOSTRUM, both healthy and sick FORMULA pigs had reduced intestinal villous heights, enzyme activities, nutrient absorption, and antioxidant levels and higher inducible nitric oxide synthetase activity (P < .05). In healthy pigs, mucosal microbial diversity remained low and diet independent. NEC pigs showed bacterial overgrowth, and a high mucosal density of Clostridium perfringens was detected in some but not all pigs. Germ-free conditions and antiserum against Clostridium perfringens toxin prevented intestinal dysfunction and NEC in formula-fed pigs, whereas the gut trophic factors, epidermal growth factor, and glucagon-like peptide 2 had limited effects. Conclusions: A subclinical, formula-induced mucosal atrophy and dysfunction predispose to NEC and bacterial overgrowth. The adverse feeding effects are colonization dependent and may be reduced by factors in colostrum that include antibodies against aggressive toxins such as those of Clostridium perfringens.}},

Two experimental variables are used throughout the study: speed and body size. Mass-specific metabolic rates of running animals can be varied by about tenfold using either variable. This first paper considers metabolic energy consumed during terrestrial locomotion. New data relating rate of oxygen consumption and speed are reported for: eight species of wild and domestic artiodactyls; seven species of carnivores; four species of primates; and one species of rodent. These are combined with previously published data to formulate a new allometric equation relating mass-specific rates of oxygen consumed (VO2/Mb) during locomotion at a constant speed to speed and body mass (based on data from 62 avian and mammalian species): VO2/Mb = 0.533 Mb-0.316.vg + 0.300 Mb-0.303 where VO2/Mb has the units ml O2 s-1 kg-1; Mb is in kg; and vg is in m s-1. This equation can be expressed in terms of mass-specific rates of energy consumption (Emetab/Mb) using the energetic equivalent of 1 ml O2 = 20.1 J because the contribution of anaerobic glycolysis was negligible: Emetab/Mb = 10.7 Mb-0.316.vg + 6.03 Mb-0.303 where Emetab/Mb has the units watts/kg. This new relationship applies equally well to bipeds and quadrupeds and differs little from the allometric equation reported 12 years ago by Taylor, Schmid-Nielsen \\&amp; Raab (1970). Ninety per cent of the values calculated from this genera equation for the diverse assortment of avian and mammalian species included in this regression fall within 25\% of the observed values at the middle of the speed range where measurements were made. This agreement is impressive when one considers that mass-specific rates of oxygen consumption differed by more than 1400\% over this size range of animals.}},

This raises the question whether coordinated movement patterns and the underlying muscular control in these animals is fully innate or whether there still exists a rapid maturation. We addressed this question by studying gait development in neonatal pigs through the analysis of spatio-temporal gait characteristics during locomotion at self-selected speed. To this end, we made video recordings of piglets walking along a corridor at several time points (from 0â€…h to 96â€…h). After digitization of the footfalls, we analysed self-selected speed and spatio-temporal characteristics (e.g. stride and step lengths, stride frequency and duty factor) to study dynamic similarity, intralimb coordination and interlimb coordination. To assess the variability of the gait pattern, leftâ€“right asymmetry was studied. To distinguish neuromotor maturation from effects caused by growth, both absolute and normalized data (according to the dynamic similarity concept) were included in the analysis. All normalized spatio-temporal variables reached stable values within 4â€…h of birth, with most of them showing little change after the age of 2â€…h. Most asymmetry indices showed stable values, hovering around 10\%, within 8â€…h of birth. These results indicate that coordinated movement patterns are not entirely innate, but that a rapid neuromotor maturation, potentially also the result of the rearrangement or recombination of existing motor modules, takes place in these precocial animals.},

    abstract = {To describe and help interpret joint movements in various forms of primate locomotion, we explored the use of Fourier analysis to represent changing joint angles as a series of sine and cosine curves added together to approximate the raw angular data. Results are presented for four joints (shoulder, elbow, hip and knee) with emphasis on the shoulder, and for five types of locomotion (catarhine primate quadrupedal walking, human hands-and-feet creeping and hands-and-knees creeping, and human walking and running). Fourier analysis facilitates functional interpretation of the angles of all four joints, by providing average joint angles and an indication of the number of peaks and troughs in the angular data. The description of limb movements also afforded us the opportunity to compare human and other catarhine joint angles, and we interpret the Fourier results in terms of locomotor posture and type. In addition, the shoulder data are useful for determination of some aspects of interlimb coordination. Non-human primates walking quadrupedally and humans creeping on hands and knees generally evince diagonal couplets interlimb coordination, in which the hand on one side strikes the substrate at about the same time as the contralateral foot or knee. Furthermore, human walking and running seem to follow a similar pattern, as indicated by Fourier analysis. From our data it is concluded that human bipedal gaits are qualitatively similar to diagonal couplets gaits in other primates, but quite different from the lateral couplets gaits used by many non-primate mammals. A number of other benefits of Fourier analysis in primate locomotion studies are also discussed. These include the ability to make statistical comparisons among various types of limb movements in a wide variety of species, a simple archival technique for limb movement data, and a greater understanding of the variability of locomotor movements.},

    abstract = {Patterns of maternal behaviour are strongly related to reproductive abilities in sows. Prepartal behaviour of sows is mainly characterised by nest-building activities, resulting in a nest that provides shelter for the piglets. In the course of domestication, sows have not lost their instinctive behaviour to nest-build, but perform at least elements of it when appropriate space and materials are available. The onset and performance of nest-building is both stimulated internally via hormones and externally via feedback from the environment. With this environmental influence, the possibilities to perform nest-building can be restricted to different extents in commercially farmed pigs. The aim of the present review is to point out the sow's need for nest-building performance as part of the natural behaviour pattern, although they are kept in different modern housing systems. With regard to increased demands for animal welfare and following changes in the legislation for pig husbandry, possible consequences for different housing systems are discussed.},
